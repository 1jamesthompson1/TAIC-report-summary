- name: Fuel Management
  explanation: Fuel management is a critical aspect of aircraft operation, ensuring that engines receive a continuous supply of fuel. In this incident, the engines lost power due to fuel starvation, which occurred because "the pilot did not switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines" (5.1). The pilot's omission was likely due to his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter, as he had "almost exclusively flown the AS350 helicopter type leading up to the incident flight" (4.2.3). The AS350 has a simpler fuel system, which may have led to the pilot inadvertently applying the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350 to the BK117 (4.2.4). This theme is relevant because proper fuel management would have prevented the engines from running dry and the subsequent loss of power.
- name: Pilot Training and Competency
  explanation: Pilot training and competency are essential for safe aircraft operation. The pilot involved in the incident had not been assessed for his type-specific knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 in the previous five years (5.2). The pilot's lack of recent experience on the aircraft type was a contributing factor to the incident, as he did not use the starting-engine checklist, which would have prompted him to switch on the fuel transfer pumps (4.2.7). The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that the pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117 (5.3). This theme is relevant because adequate training and competency checks could have ensured the pilot was familiar with the BK117's fuel system and procedures, potentially preventing the incident.
- name: Use of Checklists
  explanation: The use of checklists is a standard safety practice in aviation to ensure that all necessary procedures are followed. In this case, the pilot did not refer to a written checklist, which would have prompted him to switch the fuel transfer pumps on and turn the dimmer switch off (5.6). The operator did not require pilots to refer to written checklists if they lacked recent experience on an aircraft type (5.6). This theme is relevant because adherence to the checklist could have captured the pilot's omission and prevented the helicopter from taking off with the fuel transfer pumps switched off (4.2.7).
- name: Cockpit Lighting and Warning Systems
  explanation: Cockpit lighting and warning systems are designed to alert pilots to potential issues that require immediate attention. In this incident, a cockpit lighting modification adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight when the dimmer switch was on (5.4). The helicopter was not designed to generate an aural warning of a critically low fuel level in the supply tanks, which could have alerted the pilot to the potential loss of engine power (5.5). This theme is relevant because if the caution lights had been visible or an aural warning had been present, it could have alerted the pilot to the incorrectly configured fuel system and the low fuel levels in the supply tanks, potentially preventing the incident.
- name: Aircraft Design and Systems
  explanation: The design of an aircraft's systems can significantly impact its safety. In this incident, the design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if the fuel system was mismanaged and the low-fuel-level warnings were not seen (4.1.2). Later helicopter designs incorporated fuel supply tanks of different capacities, allowing more time for a pilot to recognize and correct issues before both engines lost power (4.4.2). This theme is relevant because the aircraft's fuel system design contributed to the rapid loss of power in both engines, leaving the pilot with little time to react.
- name: Organizational Factors and Oversight
  explanation: Organizational factors and oversight play a crucial role in maintaining safety standards. In this case, the operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough (5.3). The shared delegation of training and competency responsibilities between three managers made it harder for the operator to ensure that all training and competency requirements were being met (4.6.4). This theme is relevant because a clear delineation of duties and effective oversight could have ensured that the pilot was adequately trained, current, and competent, which might have prevented the incident.
