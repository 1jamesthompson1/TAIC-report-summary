    '
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The pilot's lack of recent experience on the BK117 and his familiarity with the AS350's simpler fuel system likely led to the mismanagement of the BK117's fuel system, causing fuel starvation ("The following analysis discusses the circumstances leading up to and contributing to the double engine power loss" (4.1.2), "A possible reason for the pilot's omission was his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter" (4.2.3), "The pilot could have inadvertently applied the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350" (4.2.4)).
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 25
  explanation: The pilot had not been assessed for his aircraft type knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 since 2009, and he lacked recent experience on the aircraft type, which directly contributed to the incident ("The pilot should not have operated the flight because he had not been assessed for his type-specific knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 in the previous five years, and he lacked recent experience on the aircraft type" (5.2)).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The pilot's unfamiliarity with the BK117's fuel system due to lack of recent experience and training on this aircraft type was a contributing factor to the incident ("A possible reason for the pilot's omission was his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter" (4.2.3), "The pilot could have inadvertently applied the more familiar fuel management technique for the AS350" (4.2.4)).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in this incident as it was a single-pilot operation and there is no mention of teamwork, communication, or decision-making with other crew members in the provided document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The pilot did not use the starting-engine checklist, which would have prompted him to switch on the fuel transfer pumps and switch off the fuel prime pumps after engine start, contributing to the fuel starvation ("The starting-engine checklist for the helicopter included prompts for the pilot to switch off the fuel prime pumps and switch on the fuel transfer pumps after engine start. The pilot did not use this checklist" (4.2.7)).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that the pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117, indicating issues with the organizational safety culture ("The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that this pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117" (5.3)).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While there is no direct mention of risk management and analysis processes, the lack of a robust system to ensure pilot proficiency and currency could be indicative of inadequate risk management within the organization ("The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough" (5.3)).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The operator did not have additional requirements or procedures above the legal currency required under CAR Part 61, and the pilot had flown the BK117 type on five occasions without meeting these currency requirements, indicating issues with regulatory oversight and compliance ("The operator in this case did not have any additional requirements or procedures above or beyond the legal currency required under CAR Part 61" (4.5.4)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's situational awareness was likely compromised due to the modification of the cockpit lighting, which affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight when the dimmer was on, and the lack of an aural warning for low fuel levels in the supply tanks ("A cockpit lighting modification to the helicopter had adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, when the dimmer switch was on" (5.4)).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of emergency response preparedness or its impact on the incident in the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The inquiry found no mechanical reason for the engines' loss of power, indicating that maintenance and inspection regimes were not a contributing factor to the incident ("The inquiry found no mechanical reason for the engines' loss of power on the incident flight" (4.1.1)).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The incident was not related to the use of automation, as it was a result of the pilot''s mismanagement of the fuel system and not an automated system failure.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of communication issues contributing to the incident in the provided document, as it was a single-pilot operation and the focus was on the pilot''s actions and omissions.

    '
- name: Other
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The design of the BK117 fuel system, which allowed both engines to lose power nearly at the same time due to fuel mismanagement, and the lack of an aural warning for low fuel levels contributed to the incident ("the design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if a pilot mismanaged the fuel system and did not see the low-fuel-level warnings" (4.1.2), "The BK117 was not designed to have an aural warning to alert pilots to low fuel levels in the supply tanks" (4.3.1)).
