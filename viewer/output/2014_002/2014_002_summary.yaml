- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of fatigue or alertness issues in the document. The pilot's lack of recent experience and training is discussed, but there is no indication that fatigue or alertness was a factor ("the pilot lacked recent experience and training on the aircraft type" (4.1.2)).
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not indicate that communication or crew resource management played a role in the incident. The focus is on the pilot''s actions and the systems of the helicopter, rather than on communication with crew or other personnel.

- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot's lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter and the absence of recent training or competency checks on this aircraft type contributed to the incident ("A possible reason for the pilot's omission was his lack of recent experience on the BK117 helicopter" (4.2.3), "the pilot in volved in this incident had not been tested or checked in this way, and according to his training records had not been assessed for his aircraft type knowledge or checked for competency on the BK117 since 2009" (4.5.2)).
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The incident was not related to maintenance procedures or compliance. The inquiry found no mechanical reason for the engines' loss of power, and the power losses were due to fuel starvation, not maintenance issues ("The inquiry found no mechanical reason for the engines' loss of power on the incident flight" (4.1.1)).
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of fire detection or suppression systems in relation to the incident. The issue was related to fuel management and not fire safety.

    '
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that the pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117, which is a regulatory compliance and safety management issue ("The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough to ensure that this pilot was proficient and sufficiently current to fly the BK117" (5.3)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The pilot's situational awareness was likely compromised due to the modification of the cockpit lighting, which affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, and the absence of an aural warning for low fuel levels in the supply tanks ("the modification of the cockpit lighting adversely affected the readability of the caution lights during daylight, when the dimmer was on" (4.1.2), "the helicopter was not designed to generate an aural warning of a critically low fuel level in the supply tanks" (5.5)).
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The design of the BK117 fuel system, which allowed both engines to lose power nearly simultaneously due to fuel mismanagement, and the lack of an aural warning for low fuel levels contributed to the incident ("the design of the BK117 fuel system meant that both engines would lose power at nearly the same time if a pilot mismanaged the fuel system and did not see the low-fuel-level warnings" (4.1.2), "The BK117 was not designed to have an aural warning to alert pilots to low fuel levels in the supply tanks" (4.3.1)).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The operator's lack of a robust system to ensure pilot proficiency and currency represents a failure in risk assessment and management, as it did not adequately mitigate the risk of a pilot lacking recent experience on a specific aircraft type ("The operator's system for maintaining oversight of its pilots' proficiency and currency was not robust enough" (5.3)).
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The document does not discuss emergency response planning and coordination as a contributing factor to the incident.

    '
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no evidence in the document to suggest that the pilot was distracted by non-essential activities during the operation of the aircraft.

    '
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The incident was not related to structural integrity or material fatigue. The engines lost power due to fuel starvation, not structural or material failure ("The inquiry found no mechanical reason for the engines' loss of power on the incident flight" (4.1.1)).
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 30
  explanation: 'Human error played a significant role in the incident, as the pilot failed to switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines, and did not use the checklist that would have prompted him to do so ("Both engines lost power due to fuel starvation, because the pilot did not switch on the fuel transfer pumps after starting the engines" (5.1), "the pilot did not refer to a written checklist; had he done so he would have been prompted to: switch the fuel transfer pumps on, which would have prevented the fuel starvation" (5.6 (invalid formatted quote))).'
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'While the operator''s system for maintaining pilot proficiency and currency was inadequate, the document does not specifically discuss safety culture or organizational influences as a direct contributing factor to the incident.

    '
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather was not mentioned as a factor in the incident. The focus was on fuel management and the pilot''s actions.
