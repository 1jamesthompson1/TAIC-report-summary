  \ of the track warrant control operating system is reliant  on the performance \n\
  of a train controller in planning, prepar ing and issuing a track warrant accurately\
  \ and on the \nrecipient compl ying with all aspects of the track warrant .  However,\
  \ humans do not operate \nwith absolute accuracy.  Boredom, distraction, fat igue,\
  \ illness, anxiety, misunderstanding and \nsensory problems lead to less -than -optimal\
  \ performance , which makes it important  that \ncontrol mechanisms , or defences,\
  \  are in place  to prevent human error resulting in an \naccident .  One such foreseeable\
  \ risk associated with the track warrant control operating \nsystem is a driver\
  \ overrunning the terminating limit of their  track warrant.   \n4.1.2.  The t rack\
  \ warrant control operating system  operates over about 60% of the main  line rail\
  \ \nnetwork.  The f ailure of the track warr ant control system in this case could\
  \ have led to the \nsouthbound train colliding with the hi -rail vehicle while the\
  \ track worker was placing the \nCompulsory Stop Protection boards had this task\
  \ not already been completed and the hi -rail \nvehicle taken clear of the track.\
  \  \n4.1.3.  Rules and operating procedures in place to reduce the risk of a driver\
  \ overrunning the \nterminating limit of a track warrant running authority  includ\
  \ ed:   \n\uF0B7 the driver's  read -back and the train controller's confirmation\
  \ of the read -back to ensur e \nthat the track warrant ha d been recorded correctly\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the illuminated clipboard in the locomotive cab to display the driver's\
  \ active \ntrack warrant running authority  \n\uF0B7 the driver  making mandatory\
  \  channel one radio broadcasts stating his train \nnumber, the loc ation approached\
  \ and the terminating l imit of the track \nwarrant  running authority   \n\uF0B7\
  \ the driver  calling the terminating limit of the track warrant running authority\
  \ \nwhen making a clause 10 radio broadcast to train control to confirm the \ntrain's\
  \ progress  \n\uF0B7 the train controller checking and accurately recording the\
  \ progress of the \ntrain on the train control diagram . \n4.1.4.  The following\
  \ analysis discusses possible reasons for the driver o verrunning  the limit of\
  \ his \ntrack warrant  by some 14.6 kilometres  and how each of t hese defences\
  \ in the system failed to \nintervene and prevent the track warrant overrun.  \n\
  4.1.5.  The analysis also consider s the following safety issues : \n\uF0B7 there\
  \ was little or no  warning systems  built in  to KiwiRail's procedures to mitigate\
  \ the \nrisk of the track warra nt system failing due to human error  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ driver of the southbound train had been prescribed a collection of medication\
  \ s that \neither singularly or collectively had the potential to adversely affect\
  \ his performance, and \nthis had gone undetected or unresolved  by KiwiRail's medical\
  \ professionals  \n\uF0B7 there was no requirement for general medical practitioners\
  \ to inform appropriate \nauthorit ies when medical issues were  diagnosed that\
  \ could affect the performance of \npeople working in safety -critical roles in\
  \ the rail in dustry . \n4.2. The incident  \n4.2.1.  At some time after receiving\
  \ his track warrant to proceed from Seddon to Parikawa, the driver \nof the southbound\
  \ train was under the impression  that his track warrant terminated at Pines \n\
  despite what he had written on his copy of the tr ack warrant .  The driver was\
  \ unable to explain \nwhy that happened.  A driver is unlikely to exceed the limit\
  \ of his track warrant  deliberately , so \nhe must have genuinely believed that\
  \ he was authorised to take his train to Pines.  A n analysis \nof the train e vent\
  \ recorder show ed that the driver was by all accounts handling his train \n \n\n\
  << Page 12 >>\n Final Report RO -2012-104 properly and complying with all the mandatory\
  \ radio calls as though he were  taking his train to \nPines.  \n4.2.2.  The driver\
  \ of the southbound train overhear d on the open radio channel the tr ain controller\
  \ \nconversing with the driver of the northbound train about  his track warrant\
  \ calls, all of which \nwere  about crossing with his southbound train at Pines.\
  \  This could have either caused or \ncontributed to his developing or maintaining\
  \ that mind -set.  Nevertheless, there were \nprocedures in place designed to capture\
  \ such an error.   These are discussed below.  \nIssuing the track warrant  \n4.2.3.\
  \  The process for issuing the  track warrant number 18 to the driver  of the southbound\
  \ train to \ntake his train from Sedd on to Parikawa  was conducted in accordance\
  \ with KiwiRail 's operating \nprocedures .  The train controller had planned well\
  \ and ma de allowance for the late running of \nthe southbound train , the shunt\
  \ work at Wharanui  and the fact that there was a planned work \nactivity between\
  \ Parikawa and Pines.  The driver of the southbound train mistakenly recorded \n\
  his train number as his homeward Train 726  on the track warrant , instead of Train\
  \ 723 .  His \nmistake was picked up by the train controller during the driver 's\
  \ read -back and was corrected.  \nThe driver correctly wrote  Parikawa as the limit\
  \ of his track warrant.  \n4.2.4.  The process for ensuring  that the track warrant\
  \ was issued  accurately  and recorded accurately \nby the train driver was successfully\
  \ accomplished.  The driver incorrectly record ing the train \nnumber as the one\
  \ with which  he was to return to Picton could simply have been him \ninadvertently\
  \ transposing the numbers of the two train s he was going to drive that night, or\
  \ it \ncould have been a sign that his mind was already on the return journey and\
  \ completing his \nshift.  Either way, it was the first indicator that his performance\
  \ was not optimal.  \nChannel one radio calls  \n4.2.5.  The driver was required\
  \ to make general  transmissions on the local channel one radio each \ntime he approach\
  \ ed a track warrant station .  On each of those occasions he was required to \n\
  check the track w arrant on the clipboard in front of him and transmit the terminating\
  \ limit of \nthe track warrant .  The driver said that he did read his track warrant\
  \ .  However,  it is highly \nlikely that he  either did not  read it or did not\
  \ do so thoroughly , otherwise he would have read \nthat his track warrant terminated\
  \ at Parikawa , not Pines . \n4.2.6.  The driver not  adhering to standard track\
  \ warrant procedures was another indicator that his \nperformance was below optimal\
  \ .   \n  Clause 10 radio check call  \n4.2.7.  The final opportunity to correct\
  \ the train driver's error was during the required clause 10 call \nwhen departing\
  \ W haranui , during which the train driver incorrectly referred to Pines instead\
  \ of \nParikawa as the terminating limit of his track warrant .  The train controller\
  \ had only been \noperating the desk for about 12 minutes following the hand -over\
  \ and missed that the driver \nhad given the wrong terminating track warrant station.\
  \  KiwiRail procedures  for train \ncontrollers were designed to detect such an\
  \ error .  \n4.2.8.  Section 10.1 - Operating Instructions for Train Control stated\
  \ in part:  \n12.8.4  Rule 401 e - A proceed track warrant which is issued to an\
  \ addressee \nand has an anticipated 2 hours or more to run  from the \"repeat \n\
  correct time\" before the limits will be cleared, must have a clause 10 \ncall specified\
  \ from a Warrant Station at approximately each hourly \ninterval and at a Warrant\
  \ Station which is in the vicinity of 25 to 30 km \nfrom the terminating limit .\
  \  The circled number of the track warrant \nmust be shown adjacent to the blue\
  \ line on the diagram alongside \neach of the clause 10 calls.  \n When the addressee\
  \ calls, they will advise the location from where the \ncall is being made as well\
  \ as the terminating limit of the warrant they \nhold.  A check to confirm this\
  \ information must be made against the \nwarrant line drawn on the diagram, in addition\
  \ to the call being logged \nin TWACS (if in use), the time must also be endorsed\
  \ alongside the call \n \nFinal Report RO -2012-104 \n<< Page 13 >>\n location on\
  \ the di agram and the relevant circled track warrant number \ncrossed out.  \n\
  4.2.9.  Had train controller B followed  Rule 401  e and referred to the track warrant\
  \ line drawn on the \ntrain control diagram, he would have seen that the terminating\
  \ limit for track warrant 18 was \nParikawa and not Pines as the driver reported.\
  \  By not complying with the operating \ninstructions , train controller B missed\
  \ the opportunity  to correct the driver's mistake  and \nconsequently prevent the\
  \ track warrant overrun .   \n4.2.10.  Train controller B's error was c onsistent\
  \ with errors he had made when sitting his  \"track \nwarrant control administration\
  \ \" module  when undergoing  his most recent biennial train control \ntheory assessment\
  \ some nine months before this incident.  At th at time h e had answered \ncorrectly\
  \ five of the 10 questions from the module.  Two of the incorrectly answered questions\
  \ \nwere:   \n\uF0B7 what colours are used on the train control diagram to represent\
  \ \nmovements authorised by track warrant?  \n\uF0B7 what happens in TWACS when\
  \ a call at a location is actioned?  \n4.2.11.  KiwiR ail's Operating Rules and\
  \ Procedures, Section 10.3, Instruction 5.2 stated in part:  \nA pass mark of 80%\
  \ will apply to all papers sat. The assessor will identify any  \nincorrect answer\
  \ and following tuition on an educative basis confirm personnel \nunderstanding\
  \  by way of oral assessment, or, as deemed necessary by the Manager, \ntraining\
  \ intervention will be arranged.   \n4.2.12.  Although train controller  B had answer\
  \ ed correctly only five of the 10 questions  from the track \nwarrant control administration\
  \ module, KiwiRail di d not require him to sit an alternative paper.  \nInstead\
  \ he received tuition from  the assessor, who  without reference to the train controller's\
  \ \nmanager then approved him to continue his  train control duties.  \n4.2.13.\
  \  Instruction 5.2 is unclear on whether a failure t o achieve an 80% pass mark\
  \ should result in \nthe train controller undergoing further training and sitting\
  \ another paper.  The safe \ninterpretation of Instruction 5.2 is that the train\
  \ controller must answer at least 80% of the \nquestions, and that the assesso r\
  \ can provide tuition and an oral assessment for no more than \n20% incorrect answers.\
  \  Based on this interpretation, a failure to achieve an 80% pass mark \nshould\
  \ therefore have resulted in the train controller having to sit an alternative exam\
  \ paper.  \nSince  this incident the train control manager has determined that a\
  \ train controller will have to \nsit an alternative paper when an 80% pass mark\
  \ is not achieved.  Tuition on an educative \nbasis and oral assessment s should\
  \ only be used for those incorrectly answe red questions \nproviding the candidate\
  \ achieves the 80% pass mark.   \n4.2.14.  The train controller's knowledge  deficien\
  \ cy at the time of his biennial theory assessment  was \na factor that contributed\
  \ to the incident.  KiwiRail will in future need to address the ambigu ity \nwith\
  \ Instruction 5.2 and ensure that it has robust procedures for addressing knowledge\
  \ \ndeficiencies in staff working in safety -critical roles . \nMissing defences\
  \  \nSafety issue  - There was little or no warning system built in  to KiwiRail's\
  \ procedures to mi tigate the risk \nof the track warrant control system failing\
  \ due to human error.  \n4.2.15.  At the time of this track warrant overrun , train\
  \ controller s knew only the approximate location s \nof trains within track warrant\
  \ control territory by relying on the paper -based train control \ndiagram and the\
  \ clause 10 radio transmissions from drivers .  The operating system relie d \n\
  heavily on train controllers recording trains' progress accurately on the train\
  \ control diagram, \nand on train drivers and other track users complying wit h\
  \ the terms of their running authorities \nand track occupations.  The safeguards\
  \ at that time for prevent ing track warrant overruns all \ninvolve d human input.\
  \  \n4.2.16.  Technology exist ed that could have provide d an alternative, independent\
  \ and automatic \ndetection of trains that had or were about to overrun the limits\
  \ of their track warrant s, such as \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report RO -2012-104\
  \ global positioning system  (GPS)  based systems.  When considering that 60% of\
  \ the controlled \nrail network relies on track warrant control and that the consequences\
  \ of a tra in overrunning \nits track warrant could be serious , the risk to the\
  \ operation was high .   \n4.2.17.  On 19 December 2014 KiwiRail introduced a software\
  \ application called 'Watchdog ' to \nmonitor the GPS position s of trains to ensure\
  \ they remain ed inside valid track warr ant \nauthority limits.  An alert is activated\
  \ in train control when a train is detected outside its track \nwarrant authority\
  \ limit.  As well as an audible alert, the train controller receive s a message\
  \ on \nthe computer screen stating : \n\uF0B7 the train number  \n\uF0B7 the date\
  \ and time  \n\uF0B7 the track warrant number  \n\uF0B7 the metrage, location and\
  \ line of the overrun . \n4.2.18.  When an alert is received the train controller\
  \ must:  \n\uF0B7 immediately refer to the train control diagram to establish the\
  \ risk of a collision with \nanother train or work group , then \n\uF0B7 make a\
  \ verbal radio transmission over the open radio channel using the phrase [Train\
  \ \nnumber/s] from control STOP, STOP, STOP and keep repeating the phrase until\
  \ receiving \nacknowledgement.   \n4.2.19.  The train control shift manager also\
  \ receives the overrun alert  by text message and email as a \nback -up in the event\
  \ that the train controller has yet to lo g in to the Operations Management \nSystem7\
  \ due to a shift change or is away from the desk.   \n4.2.20.  The 'Watchdog ' application\
  \ is a secondary safety overlay tool for track warrant control  using a \ncombination\
  \ of GPS information, cellular service providers, a KiwiRail Management System \n\
  unit fitted to each locomotive , and software applications.  There are a number\
  \ of identified  \ncellular black spots on the rail network  where cel lular coverage\
  \ is not available .  Because a \ntrain does not provide positional updates when\
  \ travelling within  a cellular black spot, the track \nwarrant overrun detection\
  \ is not available until the train enters a location with cellular \ncoverage. \
  \ Currently th ere is cellular coverage over about 80% of the network operating\
  \ under \ntrack warrant control.    \n4.2.21.  The action taken by KiwiRail to introduce\
  \ the 'Watchdog' software application , to monitor the \nGPS location s of train\
  \ s and alert train control automatically when they exit the limit s of their \n\
  operating authorit ies, has addressed this safety issue.  \nFindings  \n1. The driver\
  \ of the southbound train overran the limits of his track warrant because \nhe forgot\
  \ which track warrant station he had written on his track warrant a nd \ndeveloped\
  \ a mind -set that he had authority to travel to the next track warrant \nstation\
  \ instead.  \n2. The d river of the southbound train overr an the limits of his\
  \ track warrant and \ncreated the potential for a collision between his train and\
  \ a high -rail vehicl e that \nhad been occupying the track in the next section\
  \ ahead.  \n3. The driver of the southbound train did not follow the required procedure\
  \ for \nchecking the limits of his track warrant , and in not doing so was denied\
  \ the \nopportunity to  realise the limit of his  track warrant and thus  prevent\
  \ his train \noverrunning its limits.  \n                                      \
  \                  \n7 The Operations  Management System is one of the main systems\
  \ for managing the railway, including \nadministering speed restrictions and timetables\
  \ and reporting on the usage of the network and the efficiency \nof the rail network\
  \ and its trains.    \n \nFinal Report RO -2012-104 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4. The train\
  \ controller operating the desk at the time of the incident did not follow \nthe\
  \ required procedures for checking and monitoring the progress of the \nsouthbound\
  \ train , and in not doing so the opportunity to detect the driver's error \nand\
  \ prevent the track warrant overrun  was lost . \n5. At the time of the overrun\
  \ t here was little or no technological warning system  built \nin to KiwiRail's\
  \ procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant syste m failing \ndue to\
  \ human error.  KiwiRail has since addressed this safety issue with the \nintroduction\
  \ of a global positioning syste m-based system that alerts the train \ncontroller\
  \ when a train has exceeded the limits of its track warrant.  \n4.3. Train driver\
  \ perfor mance  \n4.3.1.  The sections above make mention of two indicators that\
  \ the driver's performance was below \noptimum leading up to the incident - his\
  \ error when receiving the track warrant at Seddon, \nand in not strictly following\
  \ procedures when making his channel one and Clause 10 radio \ncalls.  The driver's\
  \ actions on learning of or realising his error in overrunning the limits of his\
  \ \ntrack warrant are also worthy of consideration.  \n4.3.2.  KiwiRail's Track\
  \ Warrant Control Rule 409 stated in part:  \n409 Warrant In Effect Once Iss ued\
  \  \n (a)  A track warrant, once issued, is in effect until either:  \n\uF0B7 the\
  \ addressee has reported clear of the limits of the track warrant,  \n or  \n\uF0B7\
  \ it has been cancelled by a further track warrant.  \n (b)  A track warrant, once\
  \ in effect, must not be altered in a ny way.  \n4.3.3.  When the driver of the\
  \ southbound train (before the drivers changed trains) asked the other \ndriver\
  \ to see his track warrant, he altered it by crossing out the destination of Parikawa\
  \ and \nchang ing it to Pines.  At that time the track warrant had no t been cancelled\
  \ and was therefore \nstill valid.  In doing so he contravened  Track Warrant Control\
  \ Rule 409.  \n4.3.4.  The driver's action had no bearing on the incident because\
  \ the track warrant overrun had \nalready occurred  and the original was held in\
  \ TWACS at the National Train Control Centre .  \nHowever, it does raise further\
  \ questions about the driver 's state of mind and how that could \nhave influenced\
  \ the incident.  The Commission considered what factors could have \ncontributed\
  \ to the driver 's performance on the nig ht. \nFatigue  \n4.3.5.  The driver's\
  \  roster was unremarkable and it alone should not have caused him to be suffering\
  \ \nfrom fatigue.  However, the time of day could have been a factor.  T he early\
  \ hours of the \nmorning when he started his shift is a period when human perf ormance\
  \ is known to be at its \nlowest due to the circadian rhythm of the body clock causing\
  \ a strong drive for sleep.  \n4.3.6.  There are factors other than his roster that\
  \ need to be considered.  His roster would have  \ngovern ed to a certain extent\
  \ the opportunit ies the driver had to rest and sleep.  However, \nwhether those\
  \ opportunities were  taken by the driver and the quality of his sleep were  \n\
  important considerations for whether he might have been suffering from fatigue.\
  \  The driver \nhad a long history of ailmen ts and  medication prescribed to treat\
  \ those ailments.  Ailments \nand certain  medications can affect a person's quality\
  \ of sleep.  These are discussed in the \nfollowing section.  \n  \n \n\n<< Page\
  \ 16 >>\n Final Report RO -2012-104 Medical  \nSafety issue  - The driver of the\
  \ southbound train had been prescribed a colle ction of medications that \neither\
  \ singularly or collectively had the potential to adversely affect his performance,\
  \ and this had gone \nundetected or unresolved by KiwiRail's health  professionals\
  \ . \nSafety issue  - There was no requirement for general medical pr actitioners\
  \ to inform appropriate \nauthorit ies when medical issues were  diagnosed that\
  \ could affect the performance of people working in \nsafety -critical roles in\
  \ the rail industry . \n4.3.7.  At the time of the incident the driver had been\
  \ prescribed several medicatio ns.  He h ad been \nprescribed 450 mg of tramadol\
  \ tablets daily for pain relief.  The Medsafe data sheet included \ninformation\
  \ to patients stating in part:  \n\u2026 that due to its sedative effect, patients\
  \ should be advised to avoid driving or \noperating machinery w hilst taking tramadol.\
  \  \n4.3.8.  The Medsafe data sheets for amitriptyline hydrochloride  included information\
  \ stating in part:  \nThe medicine may impair alertness in some patients; operation\
  \ of automobiles and \nother activities made hazardous by diminished alertness sh\
  \ ould be avoided.   \n4.3.9.  The data sheets contained similar information for\
  \ patients with respect to Neurontin \n(gabapentin ), stating in part:  \nNeurontin\
  \ may impair your ability to drive a car or operate potentially dangerous \nmachinery.\
  \  Until it is known that thi s medication does not affect your ability to \nengage\
  \ in these activities, do not drive a car or operate potentially dangerous \nmachinery.\
  \  \n4.3.10.  The data sheet for terazosin tablets stated in part:  \nPatients should\
  \ also be told that drowsiness or somnolence can occu r with \nterazosin, requiring\
  \ caution in people who must drive or operate heavy machinery.  \n4.3.11.  Two months\
  \ before the incident, the driver had undergone  an ACC -sponsored comprehensive\
  \ \npain assessment at Burwood Pain Management Centre .  From the assessment he\
  \ had been  \nreported as having persistent pain in his tailbone region with no\
  \ radiation and no other \nassociated symptoms.  He had described pain levels fluctuating\
  \ from very low on a good day \nto seven to eight out of 10 on bad days, usually\
  \ later during the day.   On those bad days his \npain had been  aggravated at times\
  \ by walking and sitting, stress and anxiety.  He had been  \nreported as increasing\
  \ his daily alcohol intake levels somewhat in the two years since his non -\nwork\
  \ accident and he was then  drinking around nine standard drinks per day. \n4.3.12.\
  \  The driver also reported that on the day of the incident he was experiencing\
  \ 'considerable \npain' from an unrelated medical condition.  \n4.3.13.  The Commission's\
  \ medical specialist reviewed the driver's medical status .  His response is \n\
  paraphrased as follows :  \nThe various medications are all known to cause performance\
  \ impairment and \nbehavioural change when taken individually .  They  may also\
  \ act additively or \nsynergistically and have unknown effects when taken in combination.\
  \  One effect o f \nthe combination of Citalopram with other drugs that affect serotonin\
  \ metabolism is \nthe development of Serotonin Syndrome, which in its mildest presentation,\
  \ may \ncause irritability and adverse effects on behaviour, and anxiety, agitated\
  \ delirium, \nrestless ness, and disorientation in more severe cases.  In addition\
  \ to the effects of a \ncomplex treatment regime , many of which interfered with\
  \ serotonin metabolism, the \neffects of heavy alcohol consumption may lead to impaired\
  \ and variable breakdown \nof the prescr ibed medications in the driver, preventing\
  \ attainment of an equilibrium \nin blood drug levels, with the risk of adverse\
  \ effects of medication a constantly \nrepeated risk in his pain control.  \n \n\
  Final Report RO -2012-104 \n<< Page 17 >>\n 4.3.14.  The driver underwent  a KiwiRail\
  \ drug screen test and breath screen test following the incident , \nwhich both\
  \ proved negative.  He was not therefore directly under the influence of alcohol\
  \ while \non duty that morning.  However, i t is likely that the complex mix of\
  \ medications the driver was \ntaking in the period leading up to and at the time\
  \ of the incident, combined with his self -\nreported daily intake of alcohol, was\
  \ affecting his performance to some degree.  To what \ndegree his performance might\
  \ have been impaired and the influence this might have had on \nthe incident is\
  \ , howev er, difficult to quantify . \n4.3.15.  What is of concern , however, is\
  \ that in a period of about two years the driver wa s suffering \nfrom various work\
  \ - and non -work -related ailments and injuries and had been  allowed to \ncontinue\
  \ his safety -critical role of driving train s when he was clearly not fit to do\
  \ so while under \na combination of medications that, together with his daily alcohol\
  \ intake, was likely to impair \nhis performance.  \n4.3.16.  The c orrelation of\
  \ the driver's medical information  between the ACC medical professionals, h is\
  \ \nprivate medical practitioner and the KiwiRail health professionals  was not\
  \ well managed .  The \nKiwiRail health professionals and the driver's manager had\
  \ some information that should \nhave caused them to look deeper into the driver's\
  \ circumstances .  Howev er, not all of t he \ninformation that the KiwiRail health\
  \ professionals and the driver's manager required to make \nmeaningful assessment\
  \ s of the driver's fitness for duty was made available to them .  The \ninformation\
  \ held by the driver's private medical practi tioner should either have been offered\
  \ to \nthem by the driver, or have been automatically accessible to them.  \n4.3.17.\
  \  KiwiRail general operating rules required the driver, when prescribed his medication,\
  \ to \n\"establish whether those medications would impact on [his]  performance,\
  \ and if so, inform his \nmanager\"8.  The driver did not in this case inform his\
  \ manager.  Reliance on this general \noperating rule alone was not an effective\
  \ way of ensuring that workers performing safety -\ncritical roles were not working\
  \ when impa ired by prescribed or over -the-counter medication.  \nThe driver's\
  \ knowledge of this general operating rule is less likely to be tested during \n\
  KiwiRail's various performance observations and biennial theory assessments , which\
  \ typically \nfocus on his knowledge  of operating rules specific to his prime duty\
  \ of driving trains.  \n4.3.18.  The onus to establish whether a medication is likely\
  \ to affect a person's ability to perform a \nparticular role is better placed with\
  \ the Medical professionals, who are knowledgeable in these  \nmatters.  \n4.3.19.\
  \  The Commission has made a recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail to\
  \ introduce a \nsystem whereby KiwiRail medical professionals are automatically\
  \ granted access to \nemployees' medical records held by private medical practitioners\
  \ as neces sary to ensure \nemployees who perform safety -critical roles are not\
  \ impaired by prescription or over -counter \nmedications.  \n4.3.20.  In the aviation\
  \ industry Civil Aviation Rules require medical professionals who become aware \n\
  that their patient s are licen sed pilots, engineers  or air traffic controllers\
  \ to notify the Civil \nAviation Authority of any medical condition that could affect\
  \ their ability to perform their role s \nadequately . \n4.3.21.  The same regime\
  \ does not exist for the rail industry.  A complicating factor is  that the rail\
  \ \nregulatory regime differs from that for aviation, where the industry operates\
  \ to a set of \nnational standards that are jointly administered by the regulator\
  \ and industry participants.   \nCurrently there is no railway legislation in place\
  \ to make  requirem ents o n individuals and \norganisations outside the rail system.\

  \  to resolve this \nsafety issue .  \n \n \n                                  \

  \ 18 >>\n Final Report RO -2012-104 4.4. Health  assessments  for personnel  performing\
  \ safety -critical rail work   \nSafety issue - Safety -critical rail workers are\
  \ not required t o declare  prescribed medication s they are \ntaking when presenting\
  \ for triggered health  assessment s. \n4.4.1.  The Standard sets out the procedures\
  \ for conducting health assessment s and provides the \nmedical criteria for determining\
  \ fitness for duty.  One component of the periodic health \nassessment is a self\
  \ -administered questionnaire completed by the candidate before \npresenting to\
  \ a health professional, authorised by Kiwi Rail, for a clinical examination . \
  \ The \nquestionnaire collects a general history and helps the medical professional\
  \  to screen for \nspecific conditions that may affect rail safety task performance.\
  \  The d ata collected relates to \nmedication, sleep disorders, alcohol dependency\
  \ and psychological problems.  The se cond \npart is a clinical examination  to\
  \ conduct  a drug screening test and to assess the key body \nsystems , including\
  \ for cardiovascular, neurological, psychological, musculoskeletal, visual and \n\
  auditory problems.  \n4.4.2.  Authorised health professionals conduct heal th assessments\
  \ in line with procedures set out in \nthe Standard.  The relationship between the\
  \ health professional and the rail worker is \ngoverned by privacy laws.  The relationship\
  \ differs from the usual doctor -patient relationship \nbecause of the involveme\
  \ nt of a third party, the employer.  The health professional does not \nprovide\
  \ medical information to the employer, only  information on  the worker 's fitness\
  \ for duty \nor any restrictions, not the underlying medical conditions.   \n4.4.3.\
  \  The Standard requires the heal th professional to lia ise with the worker's general\
  \ practitioner \nand treating specialists where appropriate to clarify information\
  \ relating to the worker's \ncurrent health status.  Such communication is restricted\
  \ to health issues that affect  rail safety \nand only occur with the consent of\
  \ the worker.  However, because KiwiRail's health \nprofessionals had no knowledge\
  \ of the complex pain management regime the southbound \ndriver had been prescribed,\
  \ no communication could be initiated.  \n4.4.4.  Although  the intervals bet ween\
  \  periodic health  assessments for the driver  had been variable,  \nhe had had\
  \ five periodic health assessments from  the age of 40 , consistent with KiwiRail's\
  \ \nmedical standards .  However, h is most recent periodic assessment had occurred\
  \ in June \n2009, before  his non -work accident after which he was prescribed a\
  \ complex pain \nmanagement regime .  This was more than three years before this\
  \ incident .  The Standard \nrequired a  health assessment every two years  for\
  \ rail workers over 50 carrying out safety -\ncritical wo rk, so the driver should\
  \ have had a periodic health assessment in 2011 .  This was \nnever undertaken because\
  \ he was instead undergoing a series of triggered health \nassessments.  \n4.4.5.\
  \  However, t riggered health assessment s for rail safety workers were introduced\
  \ to  supplement \nthe periodic health assessments when there were  concern s about\
  \ workers ' health.  The \npurpose of these assessments was to take preventive action\
  \ by managing any health \ncondition s likely to affect safety.  Examples of when\
  \ triggered health  assess ments were  \nrequired include d: when reviewing a worker's\
  \ fitness to resume duty after an extended \nabsence due to injury or illness  or\
  \ a traumatic event ; following recurrent absenteeism ; \nfollowing an accident\
  \ or incident patterns ; and at a worker's request.  Unlike the periodic \nhealth\
  \ assessment, a candidate required to undergo a triggered health  assessment was\
  \ not \nrequired to complete the three -page health questionnaire  and declaration\
  \ . \n4.4.6.  Clause 8.2 of the Standard stated in part:  \nThe program of comprehensive\
  \ health assessments should be maintained \neven if more  frequent triggered health\
  \ assessments are performed for an \nindividual's particular condition.   \n4.4.7.\
  \  By not following its own procedures with respect to periodic health assessments\
  \ , KiwiRail \ndenied itself the  opportunity to learn about the various medications\
  \ the driver had been \nprescribed, as well as the amount of alcohol the driver\
  \ was consuming.  Rail personnel \nproperly following procedures, and KiwiRail setting\
  \ a culture of compliance with procedures \nset o ut in its safety system , are\
  \ key lessons arising from this inquiry ( see section 8). \n \nFinal Report RO -2012-104\
  \ \n<< Page 19 >>\n 4.4.8.  During the 12 years preceding this occurrence the driver\
  \  had presented to KiwiRail - appointed  \nhealth professional s for triggered\
  \ health assessment s on at least seven  occasi ons: in August \n2002 after experiencing\
  \ chest pains ; in November 2003 after a non -work accident when  he \ninjured his\
  \ lower back ; in late 2005 and ear ly 2006 following trespasser fatalities ; early\
  \ in \n2007 after an altercation with a customer ; in August  2009 f ollowing a\
  \ non -work injury to his \ntailbone  and most recently on 2 July 2010 .   \n4.4.9.\
  \  KiwiRail's health  professional s had  declared the driver \"fit for duty\" each\
  \ t ime he reported for \na triggered health assessment .  When reporting  for his\
  \ most recent triggered hea lth \nassessment on 22 December  2010, he had already\
  \ been prescribed the complex pain  relief \ntreatment regime  described above .\
  \  The health professional had declared the driver \"fit for \ndriving duties\"\
  \ without the driver reporting his current prescribed medic ation s. \n4.4.10. \
  \ Drivers are not qualified to assess whether an illness or a health problem is\
  \ likely to affect \ntheir ability to drive safely .  KiwiRail's  health professional\
  \ s are better placed to make those  \ndetermination s.  In order to do so , the\
  \ health profession als require record s of the  workers ' \ncurrent medical treatment\
  \ s and prescribed medication s.  If drivers are required to fill out the \nhealth\
  \ questionnaire when presenting for a triggered health assessment as well as periodic\
  \ \nassessments, they will get an add itional direct prompt to declare all prescription\
  \ medications .  \nExpert health professionals can then assess  any implications\
  \ the medication might have  on \ntheir  safety -critical  role.  \nA recommendation\
  \ has been made to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport  Agency to \naddress\
  \ this issue . \nFinding s \n6. The number of medications the driver had been prescribed,\
  \ combined with his \nself-reported daily intake of alcohol , is likely to have\
  \ impaired his performance at \nthe time of the incident, but the degree to which\
  \ his p erformance might have \nbeen impaired and the influence this might have\
  \ had on the incident are, \nhowever, difficult to quanti fy. \n7. The poor correlation\
  \  of information between the various health professionals \ninvolved with the driver\
  \ meant that he was allowed t o continue driving trains \nwhen he was clearly not\
  \ fit to do so.  \n8. It is a safety issue that private health professionals are\
  \ not required to report \nmedical conditions that could render train drivers unfit\
  \ for duty to the drivers'  \nemployer s or other appropria te authorit ies. \n\
  9. Train drivers were not required to declare to the employer any medication s they\
  \ \nwere taking  when undergoing triggered medical assessment s and rail medical\
  \ \nofficers were not granted automatic access to medical records held by \nemployees\
  \ ' private health professional .  These anomal ies meant that KiwiRail \nlost the\
  \ opportunity to detect that the driver in this case was not fit to drive trains\
  \  \nsafely . \n \n  \n \n\n<< Page 20 >>"
