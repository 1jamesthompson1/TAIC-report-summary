- There was little or no warning system built into KiwiRail's procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant control system failing due to human error. At the time of this track warrant overrun, train controllers knew only the approximate locations of trains within track warrant control territory by relying on the paper-based train control diagram and the clause 10 radio transmissions from drivers.
- 'The driver of the southbound train had been prescribed a collection of medications that either singularly or collectively had the potential to adversely affect his performance, and this had gone undetected or unresolved by KiwiRail''s health professionals.


  There was no requirement for general medical practitioners to inform appropriate authorities when medical issues were diagnosed that could affect the performance of people working in safety-critical roles in the rail industry.'
- Safety-critical rail workers are not required to declare prescribed medications they are taking when presenting for triggered health assessments.
