- name: Human Performance Limitations
  explanation: Human performance limitations are a safety theme relevant to this accident because the driver's ability to operate safely was compromised by several factors, including potential fatigue, medication, and alcohol intake. The report states that "humans do not operate with absolute accuracy" and that "boredom, distraction, fatigue, illness, anxiety, misunderstanding and sensory problems lead to less-than-optimal performance" (4.1.1). Additionally, the driver had been prescribed medications that "either singularly or collectively had the potential to adversely affect his performance" (4.3.14 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and he was consuming alcohol at levels that could impair his ability to drive safely (4.3.11). These factors likely contributed to the driver's error in overrunning the limits of his track warrant (4.3.5, 4.3.14).
- name: Inadequate Control Mechanisms
  explanation: Inadequate control mechanisms are a safety theme in this accident because the existing procedures and technologies were not sufficient to prevent the overrun of the track warrant limit. The report highlights that "there was little or no warning systems built into kiwirail's procedures to mitigate the risk of the track warrant system failing due to human error" (4.2.15 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). Although there were procedures in place designed to capture such an error, they were not effective in this case (4.2.2). The introduction of the 'Watchdog' software application after the incident, which provides automatic alerts when a train exceeds its track warrant limits, addresses this safety issue (4.2.17-4.2.21).
- name: Procedural Non-Compliance
  explanation: Procedural non-compliance is a safety theme because both the train driver and the train controller did not adhere to the required procedures, which contributed to the incident. The driver did not follow the procedure for checking the limits of his track warrant (4.3.3), and the train controller did not follow the required procedures for checking and monitoring the progress of the southbound train (4.2.9). This non-compliance resulted in a missed opportunity to detect the driver's error and prevent the track warrant overrun (4.2.7, 4.2.9).
- name: Inadequate Health Assessments
  explanation: Inadequate health assessments are a safety theme because the driver was allowed to continue in a safety-critical role despite medical conditions and medications that could impair his performance. The report identifies that the driver's medical status was not well managed, and the correlation of medical information between health professionals was poor (4.3.16). KiwiRail's health professionals and the driver's manager did not have all the information required to make meaningful assessments of the driver's fitness for duty (4.3.16). The driver was declared "fit for duty" without reporting his current prescribed medications (4.4.9).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  explanation: Communication breakdown is a safety theme because the driver's misunderstanding of his track warrant limit was not corrected due to a failure in communication between the driver and the train controller. The driver was under the impression that his track warrant terminated at a different station than it actually did, and this error was not caught during the required clause 10 call (4.2.7). The train controller missed the opportunity to correct the driver's mistake due to not complying with the operating instructions (4.2.9).
- name: Training and Knowledge Deficiencies
  explanation: Training and knowledge deficiencies are a safety theme because the train controller's lack of knowledge contributed to the incident. The train controller had previously demonstrated errors in his understanding of the track warrant control administration during his biennial train control theory assessment (4.2.10). The ambiguity in the instruction regarding the requirement for an 80% pass mark and the subsequent actions taken by KiwiRail did not address the train controller's knowledge deficiencies adequately (4.2.13, 4.2.14). This lack of knowledge was a factor that contributed to the incident (4.2.14).
