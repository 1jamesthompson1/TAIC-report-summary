  \ that are maintaining rail track is a safety -critical process.  \nAny confusion\
  \ around the procedure s to be followed, or a lack of adherence to them , \ncan\
  \ reduce  significantly  the level of protection afforded to track workers and create\
  \ \nconditions that increase the likelihood of a catastrophic event occurring. \
  \ \n3.2 In this case, t he authorisation of a work train into a worksite while a\
  \ hi-rail excavator \nwas still on th e track was a serious incident . It created\
  \ the  potential for a collision \nbetween the work train and the excavator , which\
  \  was only averted by the actions of the \nexcavator driver , who overheard the\
  \ work train being given approval to pass through \nthe worksite .  \n3.3 The following\
  \ section analyses the circumstances surrounding the event to identify \nthose factors\
  \  that increased the likelihood of the event occurring or increased the \nseverity\
  \ of its outcome.  It also examines any safety issues  that have the potential to\
  \  \naffect future operations  adversely .  \nPlanning of the operation  \nProtection\
  \ procedures  \n3.4 To ensure the safety of personnel working in a PWA , Rule 902\
  \ - Managing Multiple \nWorksites  require s all personne l to return to the designated\
  \ safe place and lock off \nbefore a rail movement is authorised through the worksite.\
  \   \n3.5 When interviewed, the RPO was familiar with this requirement and recalled\
  \ instructing \nboth site protectors to ensure personnel were locked off  for the\
  \ work train movement . \nHowever, both the site protectors, the pilot and several\
  \ staff from each workgroup \nrecalled the RPO telling them  that personnel were\
  \ not required to lock off. On this \nbasis, the Transport Accident Investigation\
  \ Commission (Commissi on) considered it \nvery likely that the RPO told the site\
  \ protectors not to lock off personnel. B y incorrectly \napplying Rule 902 , a\
  \ key safety defence  for protecting workers was removed . \n3.6 The KiwiRail daily\
  \ information bulletin showed that the intention was for the work train \nto pass\
  \ through the entire PWA  to enable it to collect concrete sleepers from Wharanui\
  \ \nbefore returning to the PWA . When interviewed, the RPO recalled thinking that\
  \ th e \ninformation contained in the daily information bulletin indicated that\
  \ the work train \nwould arrive from the north with loaded wagons of concrete sleepers\
  \ and commence \nwork upon entering the PWA . This may have influenced the RPO's\
  \ very likely decision \nto tell site protectors not to lock off personnel (see\
  \ Interpretation of Rule 902 \nparagraphs 3.19-3.24). \nPlanned u se of resources\
  \  \n3.7 While t he work train was in the PWA , the rules required that a pilot\
  \ guide the work \ntrain through the individual worksites.  Because the RPO believed\
  \ that the work train \nwould only be carrying out work for a few hours within the\
  \ PWA , they reassigned  one \nof the three original site protectors to act as the\
  \ pilot. The RPO decided  it was \nunnecessary to request an additional site pro\
  \ tector, meaning the two remaining site \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final Report RO\
  \ -2019 -104 protectors would be responsible for the two work groups  within each\
  \ worksite . In \naddition, work group  4 would be out of sight of the southern\
  \ site protector, who was \nresponsible for the wor kgroup's protection. This was\
  \ permissible,  but without everyone \nreturning to the designated safe area with\
  \ the responsible site protector  and locking \noff, it relied  on effective radio\
  \ communication as the last remaining defence against a \npotential collision. \
  \ \n3.8 In addition to the option of request ing an additional site protector  to\
  \ replace the pilot , \nthe RPO had alternative options available to ensure that\
  \ each of the geo graphically \nisolated workgroups were within sight of a site\
  \ protector.  One such option was for the \nRPO to temporarily be the site protector\
  \ for workgroup 4 while  a pilot was required  for \nthe work train. This would\
  \ have allowed workgroup 4 to be visually overseen by the \nRPO.  \nOperati onal\
  \ considerations  \nNon-technical skills - challenge and response  \n3.9 Several\
  \ participants in the pre -shift briefing  recalled  the southern site protector\
  \ \nchallenging the RPO 's instruction to not lock off track workers during the\
  \ work train \nmovement. However, the southern site protector recalled reluctantly\
  \ agreeing not to \n'lock off' personnel after initially challenging the instruction.\
  \ The site protector , who  \nreported to the RPO, was relatively n ew to the role\
  \ and less experienced than the RPO.  \nThese factors made it likely that the authority\
  \ gradient between the two resulted in the \nsouthern site protector's reluctant\
  \ agreement.  \n3.10 In addition, the re were  other , more experienced personnel\
  \ attending th e pre -shift \nbriefing  who were trained and certified in the use\
  \ of Rule 902 , such as the pilot and the \nnorthern site protector . None of them\
  \  challenge d the RPO's instruction  or support ed \nthe southern site protector's\
  \ challenge . Had they done so  effectively , the unsafe \ninstruction may have\
  \ been rectified.  \n3.11 In 2012, as part of inquiry RO -2011 -101, the Commission\
  \ issued a recommendation \n(002/12) to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport\
  \ Agency that they require: the \nExecutive of the National Rail S ystem Standards\
  \ to develop standards to ensure all rail \nparticipants meet a consistently high\
  \ level of crew resource management (now known \nas non-technical skills11); and\
  \ communication to staff that includes the use of standard \nrail phraseology. \
  \ \n3.12 Subsequent  Commission reports have also highlighted the importance of\
  \ non-\ntechnical skills in helping to prevent incidents and accidents occurring,\
  \ and the need \nfor KiwiRail to develop the necessary skills and create an awareness\
  \ of them \nthroughout the company.  The NZ Transport Agency  has updated the Commission\
  \ o n \nthe status of completed and ongoing work being undertaken by KiwiRail in\
  \ develop ing \nnon-technical skills through out its workforce (see section 5) .\
  \ As a result of the safety \nactions that have been taken and those that are currently\
  \ underway , the Commission \n \n11(Formerly known as crew resource management )\
  \ skills that complement technical skills and include the \ninterpersonal skills\
  \ of communication, leadership and teamwork and the cognitive skills of decision\
  \ -making, \nsituational awareness and task management.  Non-technical skills  are\
  \ part of human factors and bolster the \nsuccess of threat and error management\
  \ . \nFinal Report RO -2019 -104 \n<< Page 11 >>\n has not made a further recommendation\
  \ regarding the development of non -technical \nskills.  \nMissed opportunity  \n\
  3.13 During the work train movement the pilot called the RPO to  clarify the work\
  \ train 's \nactual destination.  This was an opportunity for the RPO to update\
  \ their understanding \nof the work train 's route, stop the work train movement\
  \ and modify the plan by \nrequiring all the workgroups to lock off and return to\
  \ their desi gnated safe place.  \n3.14 However, the opportunity to check the work\
  \ train's route was missed  by the RPO , and \nthe movement continued without track\
  \ workers being properly accounted for and \nwithout their being provided  with\
  \ the protection that Rule 902 should have afforded \nthem.  \nRadio procedures\
  \  \n3.15 The work area communication plan confirmed that both radio and bac kup\
  \ cell phone \ncoverage between the RPO, each individual worksite and each CSB location\
  \ was \navailable.  \n3.16 The southern site protector authorised the work train\
  \ through the worksites while the \ntrack was still occupied.  This was a result\
  \ of them believing they had received radio \nconfirmation from workgroup 4 that\
  \ the track was safe for rail movements.  \n3.17 However, it was likely that the\
  \ southern site protector overheard a radio conversation \nbetween the other workgroups\
  \ and misinterpreted this as workgroup 4 providin g \nconfirmation.  \n3.18 On a\
  \ single -channel open radio network, it is essential that each communicator has\
  \ a \nunique identifier or call sign that they always use  to provide clarity on\
  \ who is \ntransmitting and to whom messages are  directed.  On this occasion, only\
  \ the site \nprotectors had allocat ed call signs, which likely resulted in confusion\
  \ when workgroups \nwere communicating on the radio , and the southern site protector\
  \ misidentifying the \nradio call.  \nInterpretation of Rule  902 \nSafety issue:\
  \ T he New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures did not provide guidance\
  \ on \nhow to manage work trains within a worksite and did not differentiate between\
  \ a train moving \nto a point where work need s to take place and a train  carrying\
  \ out its designated work as a \nwork train.  \n3.19 Through interview and by observa\
  \ tion, the Commission was made aware of previous \noccasions when workers had been\
  \ allowed to stay locked on while a work train was \ncarrying out its designated\
  \ work within a worksite and needed to move a short \ndistance at slow speed, such\
  \ as the length of a w agon.  This procedure had not been  \ndocumented or risk\
  \ assessed , and it was unclear how it  had evolved.  \n3.20 The plan discussed\
  \ at the pre -shift meeting was like that described above.  When the \nwork train\
  \ was in the correct position, the workgroup at the sleeper discharge point \nwere\
  \ to lock on with the pilot. The practice of locking on with a pilot was not \n\
  documented in Rule 902.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report RO -2019 -104 3.21\
  \ It was likely that the lack of documented procedures for t he protection of workers\
  \ \nwhen a work train was carrying out work had led to the development of locally\
  \ \nadopted procedures.  These procedures may have worked on previous  occasions\
  \ , but \nshould have be en formally assessed and approved before being incorporated\
  \  into the \nrelevant safety management documentation.   \n3.22 The rules and procedures\
  \ at the time of the incident did not define whether a train was \na work train\
  \ for the purpose of the rules when it departed from its depot , or whether it \n\
  was a work train when it w as in a position to carry out work.   \n3.23 In addition,\
  \ Rule 902 did not contain actions to be taken for a work train or provide \nprocedures\
  \ for the loading and unloading of multiple wagons requiring small \nmovements of\
  \ a work train.  As a result, the rule was open  to interpretation and \nmodification\
  \ at a local level.   \n3.24 To help prevent a repeat of this incident, the requirements\
  \ for work train movements  in \nRule 902  of the New Zealand Rail Operating Rules\
  \ and Procedures should be clearly \nexplained. This will ensure the re is no need\
  \ to create local procedures. The Commission \nhas made a recommendation to KiwiRail\
  \ to review Rule 902 in light of this incident and \nensure that the procedures\
  \ for the operation of work trains in PWA s are appropriate \nand provide suitable\
  \ levels of protection for track workers.  \n \nFinal Report RO -2019 -104 \n<<\
