- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  explanation: Adherence to safety procedures is a critical theme in this accident, as the failure to follow established rules significantly increased the risk of a collision. The report highlights that the rail protection officer (RPO) likely instructed site protectors not to lock off personnel, which is a direct violation of Rule 902 - Managing Multiple Worksites. This rule requires all personnel to return to a designated safe place and lock off before a rail movement is authorized through the worksite ("By incorrectly applying Rule 902, a key safety defence for protecting workers was removed" (3.5)). The RPO's misunderstanding of the work train's intended route and the subsequent incorrect instructions to the site protectors led to a situation where workers were not afforded the protection they should have been under the rule ("the rail protection officer very likely instructed the site protectors to not lock off workgroups, nor require workers to return to a safe place for a rail movement, which contrasted with the requirements of Rule 902" (4.2)).
- name: Effective Communication
  explanation: Effective communication is another safety theme that played a significant role in this incident. The report indicates that there was a reliance on radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision due to the RPO's decision not to request an additional site protector ("without everyone returning to the designated safe area with the responsible site protector and locking off, it relied on effective radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision" (3.7)). However, the southern site protector misidentified a radio call, believing that workgroup 4 was clear of the track, which led to the authorization of the work train through the worksite while the track was still occupied ("The southern site protector misidentified a radio call, believing that workgroup 4 was clear of the track" (4.4)). This miscommunication was exacerbated by the lack of unique identifiers or call signs for each communicator, which likely resulted in confusion and the misidentification of radio calls ("On this occasion, only the site protectors had allocated call signs, which likely resulted in confusion when workgroups were communicating on the radio" (3.18)).
- name: Non-Technical Skills
  explanation: Non-technical skills, such as challenge and response, are crucial for ensuring safety, especially when questionable instructions are given. In this incident, the southern site protector initially challenged the RPO's instruction not to lock off track workers, but reluctantly agreed due to the authority gradient and their relative inexperience ("The site protector, who reported to the RPO, was relatively new to the role and less experienced than the RPO" (3.9)). Moreover, other experienced personnel present at the pre-shift briefing did not support the challenge, which could have rectified the unsafe instruction ("None of them challenged the RPO's instruction or supported the southern site protector's challenge" (3.10)). The importance of non-technical skills in preventing incidents has been highlighted in previous Commission reports, and the NZ Transport Agency has been working on developing these skills throughout KiwiRail's workforce ("The NZ Transport Agency has updated the Commission on the status of completed and ongoing work being undertaken by KiwiRail in developing non-technical skills throughout its workforce" (3.12)).
- name: Clarity of Operating Rules
  explanation: The clarity of operating rules is a significant safety theme, as ambiguity in the rules can lead to misinterpretation and unsafe practices. The New Zealand Rail Operating Rules and Procedures did not provide clear guidance on managing work trains within a worksite, which led to the development of locally adopted procedures that had not been formally assessed or approved ("It was likely that the lack of documented procedures for the protection of workers when a work train was carrying out work had led to the development of locally adopted procedures" (3.21)). The rules were open to interpretation and modification at a local level, which contributed to the incident ("As a result, the rule was open to interpretation and modification at a local level" (3.23)). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail review Rule 902 to ensure that procedures for the operation of work trains in Protected Work Areas (PWAs) are appropriate and provide suitable levels of protection for track workers ("The Commission has made a recommendation to KiwiRail to review Rule 902 in light of this incident" (3.24)).
- name: Resource Management
  explanation: Resource management, particularly the allocation and use of site protectors, is a theme that impacted the safety of the operation. The RPO reassigned one of the original site protectors to act as the pilot for the work train, leaving only two site protectors responsible for two workgroups within each worksite ("the rpo decided it was unnecessary to request an additional site protector, meaning the two remaining site protectors would be responsible for the two workgroups within each worksite" (3.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote))). This decision increased the reliance on radio communication and reduced the effectiveness of visual oversight, which is a critical safety measure ("This was permissible, but without everyone returning to the designated safe area with the responsible site protector and locking off, it relied on effective radio communication as the last remaining defence against a potential collision" (3.7)). The RPO had alternative options available to ensure that each of the geographically isolated workgroups were within sight of a site protector, which would have likely reduced the risk of miscommunication and increased safety ("the RPO had alternative options available to ensure that each of the geographically isolated workgroups were within sight of a site protector" (3.8)).
- name: Response to Safety Challenges
  explanation: The response to safety challenges is a theme that reflects the organizational culture and the willingness of individuals to adhere to safety protocols. In this case, the southern site protector's initial challenge to the RPO's unsafe instruction was not effectively supported by other experienced personnel, which could have prevented the unsafe practice from being carried out ("The southern site protector recalled reluctantly agreeing not to 'lock off' personnel after initially challenging the instruction" (3.9)). The lack of support for the challenge and the failure to rectify the unsafe instruction indicate a need for a stronger safety culture where individuals feel empowered to speak up and are supported when they do so ("Had they done so effectively, the unsafe instruction may have been rectified" (3.10)). This theme is closely related to the development of non-technical skills and the importance of fostering an environment where safety is prioritized and challenges to unsafe practices are taken seriously.
