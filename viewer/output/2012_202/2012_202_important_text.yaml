  \ from the  north to northwest at about 20 knots .  The skies were overcast \nand\
  \ the visibility good.  Where the Torea  was drift fishing it was sheltered from\
  \ the sea by the \nshallow reef of Seal Rocks.  The weather conditions were therefore\
  \ suitable for  the trip . \n4.1.2.  The crew held the appropriate qualifications\
  \ to operate the Torea  on commercial passenger \nfishing charters.  \n4.1.3.  The\
  \ Torea  had a current survey and carried  more than the correct lifesaving equipment\
  \ for its \noperation .  There was no malfunction of the  machinery installation\
  \ or navigation equipment on \nthe day.  \n4.1.4.  After the Torea  struck the rock\
  \ and beg an flooding, t he actions of the crew in resolving the \nsituation were\
  \ well thought out and co -ordinated.  The response from emergen cy services was\
  \ \nrapid and followed good search and res cue procedures.  The result was  that\
  \ all passengers \nand crew were  rescued without injury.  \n4.1.5.  The following\
  \ analysis describes the circumstances that led to the Torea  running aground. \
  \  \nAlso discussed is the one key safety issue arisi ng out of this accident -\
  \ the Torea  was carrying \nmore passengers than it was permitted to carry.  \n\
  4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The Torea 's skipper was targeting blue cod species\
  \ for his passengers.  The blue cod's habitat \nis on rocky bottoms4 close to reefs\
  \ and the coast and out to about 150 metres ' depth.  Fishing \nfor blue cod often\
  \ involves manoeuvring close to rocks and rocky outcrops at slow speed.  One \n\
  of the risks with this type of operation is incurring what is usually slow speed\
  \ bumps and \nscrapes on rocks, particul arly when navigating around areas such\
  \ as Sea l Rocks, where the \naccuracy of underwater charting surveys is limited.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  There are a number of measures a skipper can take to reduce the risk\
  \ of this type of \noperation, and the skipper was using most of these.  He was\
  \ aware from his previous \nexperience that uncharted rocks existed in the area.\
  \  He:  \n\uF0B7 studied the largest -scale chart of the area  \n\uF0B7 studied\
  \ the computerised chart plo tter with his previous tracks and depths of water \n\
  available to estimate where it was safe to navigate  \n\uF0B7 usually operated at\
  \ slow speed (or drifted ) \n\uF0B7 had his crew keeping a lookout for shallow water\
  \ near the bow of the vessel .   \n4.2.3.  Before the master took the Torea  over\
  \ the foul ground he consulted  his computerised \nnavigation system , which  showed\
  \ all his previous tracks in the area.  This navigation system \nwas interfaced\
  \ with the echo sounder and plotted the depth of water under the vessel for each\
  \ \nsaved track.   Therefore, the navigation system  built up a map of the seabed\
  \ over which the \nvessel had previously travelled.  \n4.2.4.  He determined from\
  \ his previous tracks where he knew uncharted rocks exist ed.  At the end of \n\
  his second drift, where he was positioned between 2  previous successful tracks,\
  \ the master \nput the throttle forward  and turned to the east in to what he believed\
  \  to be clear water.  One of \nthe crew members  had just started telling  the\
  \ master that the water depth was reducing  when \nthe Torea  collided with the\
  \  rock.   In this case the collision could possibly have been avoided, \nor the\
  \ damage minimised , had the skipper kept the Torea 's speed to a minimum until\
  \ he was \nsure he was clear of the rocky area.  \n  \n                        \

  \ 2009)  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report 12 -202 4.3. Passenger  numbers  \nSafety\
  \ issue  - There were 24 passengers on board the Torea  when it was only certified\
  \ to \ncarry 20 passengers . \n4.3.1.  The trip leader had arranged  several similar\
  \ charters before  and because of this the master \nassumed that the leader was\
  \ aware of the maximum 20 -person limit .  There was a set fee for \nthe charter,\
  \ so the cost per person reduced as the size of the group inc reased, up to a \n\
  maximum of 20.  \n4.3.2.  On 23 August the trip leader  had faxed a list of the\
  \ names to the port security officer .  There \nwere  24 names on the list.  T he\
  \ mas ter said that he had not seen the list.   He said he  had \nassumed  that\
  \ the copy faxed to the gatehouse at South Port New Zealand had 20 passengers \n\
  on it.   \n4.3.3.  When the passengers arrived on the wharf, they were allowed to\
  \ board without any of the crew \nchecking how many there were.  \n4.3.4.  The skipper\
  \ asked the deckhand to find out how many passengers were on board after the \n\
  Torea  had departed the wharf , so that he could make his trip report to Bluff \
  \ Fisherm en's \nRadio.  Even at that point the deckhand did not make a phys ical\
  \ count.  He said that he asked \nthe trip leader, and said that the trip leader\
  \ told him there were  20. \n4.3.5.  The Commission was not able to contact the\
  \ trip leader and speak with him following the \naccident.  He did not respond to\
  \ any attempts to contact him .  It is difficult to comprehend that \nthe trip leader\
  \ did not know how many passengers he had arranged for the trip.  Nevertheless,\
  \ \nit was the skipper's responsibility to ensure that his vessel was carrying no\
  \ more than the \npermissible number of passengers.  Fortunately  in this case ,\
  \ the Torea  had 25 passenger \nlifejackets on board, 5 more than were  required.\
  \  This meant that every person on board was \nhanded and donned a lifejacket. \
  \ T he weather conditions were good and the nature of the \nemergency allowed the\
  \ first-response team to re scue all of the passengers and crew without \ninjury.\
  \   \n4.3.6.  However, if the Torea  had had only the required number of lifejackets\
  \ on board, not all of the \npassengers would have had lifejacket s in the event\
  \ of them having to enter the water.  \n4.3.7.  It is a serious safety issue when\
  \ skippers of commercial vessels are not aware that their \nvessels are carrying\
  \ more than the maximum permitted number of persons.  A vessel's fit -for-\npurpose\
  \ certificate (its maritime document) is issued on the basis of the vessel's safety\
  \ \nmanagement system, which takes into consideration more than just the available\
  \ life -saving \nequipment.  It considers other factors, such as the type of vessel,\
  \ its operating limits, and the \ncrew-to-passenger ratio to name a few.  \n4.3.8.\
  \  Additionally, should a catastrophic event occur, the search and rescue response\
  \ will not know \nhow many people are involved.  Valuable time can be lost trying\
  \ to reconcile how many were \non board against how many have bee n rescued.  Delays\
  \ in retrieving people from the water \ncan result in serious injury or death. \
  \ \n4.3.9.  The operator has since changed its procedures to address this safety\
  \ issue, so the \nCommission has not made any recommendation s. (See section 6 for\
  \ details)  \n  \n  \nFinal report 12 -202 \n<< Page 11 >>"
