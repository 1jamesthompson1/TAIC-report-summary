Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Navigation and Charting: The skipper was aware of the risks associated with navigating close to rocks and reefs, but the accuracy of underwater charting surveys in the area was limited. The collision with the rock could have been avoided or minimized if the skipper had kept the vessel's speed to a minimum until clear of the rocky area.

2. Passenger Overload: The Torea was carrying 24 passengers when it was only certified to carry 20 passengers. The skipper assumed that the trip leader was aware of the maximum limit, and the crew did not physically count the number of passengers before departure. This safety issue could have resulted in not enough lifejackets for all passengers in the event of an emergency.

3. Safety Management System: Skippers of commercial vessels should be aware of the maximum permitted number of persons on board. The vessel's fit-for-purpose certificate takes into consideration factors such as the crew-to-passenger ratio. Not being aware of passenger overload can lead to delays in search and rescue response and potential serious injury or death. The operator has since changed procedures to address this safety issue.
