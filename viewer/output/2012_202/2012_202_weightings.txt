","0.0","30.0","The skipper made an assumption about the number of passengers based on previous interactions with the trip leader, which led to carrying more passengers than permitted (""The trip leader had arranged several similar charters before and because of this the master assumed that the leader was aware of the maximum 20-person limit"" (4.3.1)).
