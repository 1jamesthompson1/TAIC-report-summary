- The sighting distance available to drivers of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea Road level crossing safely did not comply with the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual.
- Level crossing assessments do not require the road profile and the alignment of roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured. Therefore, there are no checks made to ensure that all road-legal vehicles can pass over level crossings without becoming stuck.
