2014_101,013/16,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and all road controlling authorities to ensure that rail level crossing assessments include a measure of the road profile and compatibility with the allowable dimensions for long and low road vehicles.,"It is possible that the Te Onetea Road level crossing is one that has been affected by changes in the allowable dimensions of long, low road vehicles. Unless the profiles of all level crossings are assessed against the current allowable dimensions for long, low vehicles, the potential risk of this type of accident occurring will remain high.

The ALCAM survey measures the gradient of the road leading up to the level crossing, but does not measure the rate of change in gradient in order to record the profile or vertical alignment of the road for the purposes of ensuring that road-legal vehicles can use the level crossing safely without becoming stuck.

It is important that rail level crossings are compatible with road vehicles, and that road users are made aware of limitations on the use of at-risk level crossings, in much the same way that drivers of high vehicles are warned of low bridges and tunnels.

","The sighting distance available to drivers of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea Road level crossing safely did not comply with the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual.

","Level crossing assessments do not require the road profile and the alignment of roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured. Therefore, there are no checks made to ensure that all road-legal vehicles can pass over level crossings without becoming stuck.

2014_101,012/16,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and Waikato District Council to address this safety issue.,"A survey of the Te Onetea Road level crossing was carried out to the ALCAM standards on 20 March 2012. The sighting distances in both directions did not allow sufficient time for long vehicles to drive safely over the level crossing without being struck by a train. Therefore, a fully road-compliant long vehicle could not use the level crossing with the recommended margins for safety.

No action had been taken between the 2012 survey and the date of the accident, 27 February 2014, to mitigate the risk to road users and train vehicles.
