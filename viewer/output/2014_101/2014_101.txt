The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that  reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of impl ementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the cir cumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a pers on or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On Thursday 27 February 2014 the Northern Explorer  passenger train was on its journey from 
Auckland to Wellington.  The train passed through Te Kauwhata station at 0937 with 108 
passengers and five crew on board, heading toward s the Te Onetea Road level crossing about 
3.5 kilomet res further south.  
1.2. Meanwhile a truck and long low -loader carrying a road roller was travelling along the no -exit Te 
Onetea Road, the driver looking for a suitable place to turn his long vehicle around.  The truck 
was approaching the Te Onetea Road rail level crossing at the  same time  that the train was 
coming into view.  
1.3. The Te Onetea Road level crossing had passive controls protected by 'Stop' and 'Look for 
Trains' signs.  The truck driver entered the level crossing without stopping and his trailer unit 
grounded on the rise leading up to the rail tracks .  The truck became stuck , with its driving unit 
obstructing the track along which the train was approaching.  
1.4. The train driver saw the truck begin to pass over the level crossing and stop in the path of his 
train.  Despite his sounding the locomotive  whistle and applying emergency braking, the train 
collided with the driving unit at a speed of 78 kilometres per hour.  
1.5. The truck was substantially damaged and the truck driver was killed in the collision.  The train 
did not derail a nd suffered minor damage to the locomotive only.  None of the train passengers 
or crew was injured.  
1.6. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that in this case the 
train, which had its headlight and side 'ditch lights' switched on,  would have been visible to the 
truck driver as his truck reached the stop signs at the level crossing.  Had the driver stopped his 
truck and looked for trains, the accident would likely not have happened.   However, there were 
broader safety issues with th e level crossing that in different circumstances may have resulted 
in the accident, even if the driver had stopped at the limit line of the level crossing.   
1.7. The Commission identified two safety issues .  The first was that the view lines from the stop 
limit line on the road, along the rail tracks in both directions, did not comply with the minimum 
restart sighting distances set out in the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual, 
Part 9, Level Crossings.   It was therefore possible that when a tr ain was just out of a truck 
driver's view, a fully road -compliant heavy road vehicle would not have sufficient time to pass 
over the level crossing without being struck by the train.  
1.8. The second safety issue identified was that  level crossing assessment s do not require the road 
profile and the alignment of roads on the approach  to and passing over level crossings to be  
routinely measured .  Therefore , there are no check s made to ensure  that all road -legal vehicles 
can pass over level crossing s without becoming stuck, as happened in this case.  
1.9. The Commission has made two recommendations to the Chief Executive  of the NZ Transport 
Agency to address these safety issues.  
1.10.  A key safety lesson  arising from this accident is that drivers of road vehicles  must comply with 
compulsory stop signs at rail level crossings to give them ample opportunity to look for trains, 
assess the situation and consider any risk before proceeding.

 Final report RO -2014 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry   
2.1. The accident occurred at about 0942 on Thursday 27 February 2014.  The NZ Transport Agency 
notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) soon after the accident 
occurred.  The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commis sion Act 1990 to determine the circumstances and causes of the 
occurrence and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. The Commission investigator s travelled to  the Te Onetea Road level crossing that day to 
conduct a site investigation .  The Commission investi gators maintained contact with on -site 
personnel  from the N ew Zealand  Police Serious Crash Unit to ensure that volatile evidence was 
photographed and recorded . 
2.3. The Commission's investigators interviewed : the next-of-kin of the driver of the heavy motor 
vehicle; the driver of the Northern Explorer ; the second person travelling in the locomotive ; a 
KiwiRail engineer responsible for monitoring the condition of the Te Onetea Road  level crossing ; 
a Waikato District Council road engineer ; a local resident who was  the first person on the scene 
after the accident ; persons representing the owner of the heavy motor vehicle ; and employees 
from a construction company who assisted in loading the roller on to the trailer of the heavy 
motor vehicle.  
2.4. The Commission obtained the following records  and documents  for analysis : 
 the download ed data from the train's event recorder  
 the train control diagram  
 the signal data log  
 the train controller's voice recordings  
 the train driver's training records and timesheets  
 the security recordings from the truck operator's depot  
 the download ed data from the heavy motor vehicle  event recorder  
 the heavy motor vehicle driver's training records and log book  
 the Te Onetea Road level crossing site survey data and outputs . 
2.5. On Saturday 10 May 2014 the Commission held a controlled reconstruction of the accident at  
the Te Onetea Road  level crossing using a similar driving unit that had the same axle spacing  as 
the one destroyed in the accident , and the same semi -trailer unit transporting the same  roller .  
The Police Serious Crash Unit personnel  and representatives from KiwiRail  and Porter Haulage  
Limited  attended.  
2.6. On 23 March 2016  the Commissioners considered the draft report and approved it to be sent 
to interested perso ns for consultation.   
2.7. Submissions were received from four of the interested persons.  The Commission has 
considered all submissions and any changes as a result of those submissions have been 
included in this final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On Thursday 27 February 2014, the express passenger train Northern Explorer  (the train) was 
travelling southbound from Auckland to Wellington.  The train departed from Auckland  on 
schedule at 0750 .  
3.1.2.  The train passed through Te Kauwhata  crossing station at about 0937.  On board were 108 
passengers, the train driver, a driver under training  (in the cab with the driver) , a train manager 
and two passenger attendants.  The train's headlight and ditch lights3 were switched on.   The Te 
Onetea Road public level crossing is about 3.5 kilometres south of Te Kauwhata .  
3.1.3.  Meanwhile at 0925 a truck consisting of a prime mover and a three -axle heavy 'low -loader' 
trailer (the truck) used for transporting heavy construction equipment had arrived at a Flet cher 
Construction site on Te Onetea Road , carrying a 23 -tonne excavator on the trailer.  
3.1.4.  With the help of an assistant t he truck driver unloaded the excavator.  They then loaded  a roller 
from the worksite at Te Onetea Road that the driver was to transport t o another Fletcher 
Construction worksite.  
3.1.5.  The driver drove the truck off the Te Onetea Road worksite at 0938 , heading eastwards towards 
the Te Onetea Road  level crossing nearly 900 metres away in search of an area to turn the 
truck.  The driver was the sole occupant of the truck when it left the worksite.  
3.1.6.  The train was travelling at 85 kilometres per hour when  500 metres from the level crossing .  
The train driver saw the truck approaching the level crossing from his right -hand side (see 
Figure 1 ).

 Final report RO -2014 -101 3.1.7.  The train driver observed that the truck had already begun crossing the northbound track4 and 
it appeared to him to be still moving  when  the train was about 250 metres from  the level 
crossing .  The driver gave  a prolonged blast with the locomotive whistle  to warn the truck driver . 
3.1.8.  The train driver observed the truck  continue to cross onto the southbound5 track and stop in the 
path of the train.   The left-hand f ront wheel  of the truck  was between the rails o f the 
southbound track  (see Figure 2) .  The train driver ma de a full service brake application before  
moving the brake  handle into the emergency position  when the train was 161 metres6 from the 
level crossing .

3.1.9.  The train driver  warned  the driver under training  then  vacated his driving position  and placed  
himself in a 'safe position ' between the brake pedestal and the rear wall of the locomotive cab.  
The train was travelling at 78 kilometres per hour when it struck the truck .  The train stopped 
270 metres past the level crossing .  All the carriages and the locomotive stay ed on the track . 
None of the 108 passengers or train crew was injured. The truck driver was thrown clear of the 
truck and sustained fatal injuries . 
3.2. Site examination  
3.2.1.  There was damage to the cowcatcher7 and the front structure of the locomotive  (see Figure 3).  
The diesel fuel tank was punctured , resulting in slight seepage that was later contained .

3.2.4.  The semi -trailer had damage to  the right front corner of the skid plate8.  Most  of the hydraulic 
hoses and fittings at the front of the trailer  were severely damaged .  
3.2.5.  Passenger trains travelling south approach the Te Onetea Road  level crossing on a 400 -metre -
long, 600 -metre -radius cur ve at a maximum curve speed of 85 kilometres per hour.   
3.2.6.  Te Onetea Road is a narrow , two-way, unsealed , rural no-exit road  from Rangiriri .  The road  
provides access to three properties on the eastern side of the double -track railway level 
crossing (northbound and southbound  tracks ).  The road narrows to a single lane across the 
level crossing.  It had no posted road speed  but the road controlling authority , Waikato District 
Council,  confirmed that the ma ximum speed limit of 100 kilometres per hour  applied.  
3.2.7.  The most recent Te Onetea Road level crossing site survey , carried out on 20 March 2012 , had 
showed there were 28 road vehicle crossing s and 31 train crossings per day.  
3.2.8.  The Te Onetea Road public level crossing was equipped with passive controls9.  The NZ 
Transport Agency's Traffic  Control Devices Manual , Part 9, Level crossings, second edition, 
amendment 1  (Traffic  Control Devices Manual ), provided guidance on the use and placement of 
approved traffic sign s at public level crossings.  
3.2.9.  The Traffic  Control Devices Manual  required the road controlling authority to erect a 'level 
crossing ahead ' warning sign consisting of a steam train symbol on the left -hand side of the 
road at a minimum distance of 160 metres before  the level crossing .  The 'level crossing ahead ' 
warning sign was missing  on the day of the accident.   
3.2.10.  The road crossed the railway lines at a 55 -degree angle.  A sign10 advising as such was 
positioned 75 metres before  the level crossing, in accordance with the Traffic  Control Devices 
Manual  (see Figure 6).   
                                                        
8 The skid plate is a plate structure on a semi -trailer that forms part of the connection between the towing 
vehicle and the semi -trailer.  
9 Passive controls are where the movements of vehicles across a railway level cro ssing are controlled by 
signs, requiring road users to detect approaching trains by direct observation.  
10 An acute -to-the-right WX42 advisory sign,  indicating that the angle was less than 70 degrees.

3.2.11.  Pole-mounted railway stop assembl ies, each consisting of a crossbuck 'RAILWAY CROSSING'  
mounted above a 'STOP ' sign, were  erected on each side of the road in both directions (four in 
total ) (see Figure 7) .  Additionally, one pole assembly  in each approach direction had a  yellow 
'LOOK  FOR TRAINS'  sign.  Similarly, a '2 TRACKS ' sign warning drivers that there were two 
tracks to cross was attached to the other pole on either side of the crossing .  
 
Figure 7  
Stop assembly for the westbound  road approach  
3.2.12.  The road surface of the eastbound approach to the railway level crossing , from where the truck 
was approaching,  was generally unsealed with only a short section of chip seal just before the 
northbound track. The road surface under and between the two tracks  consisted of loosely 
compacted track ballast11.  
3.2.13.  There was a short right -hand curve on the eas tbound approach road to the level crossing (see 
Figure 6).  The road was on a rising gradient of 4.46 degrees (7 .8%) before levelling out across

 Final report RO -2014 -101 the two tracks .  The railway lines  sat above the track ballast.  A faint yellow (stop) limit line 
marking on the road surface  was 3.4 metres from the closest rail . 
3.3. The road vehicle  
3.3.1.  The truck  consisted of a 2013 -model , three -axle Kenworth driving unit towing a three -axle low-
loading trailer with a 10 -tonne load.  The overall length of the combination wa s 18.85  metres.  
3.3.2.  The driving  unit was 7.6 metres long.  The front axle was a single tyre steering axle and the rear 
two axles were dual tyre drive axles.  The fifth wheel (trailer connection) was between the 
second and third axles , approximately 5.24 metres  from the front of the truck.  The tractor unit 
had a manual gearbox with a limited slip differential.  The certificate of fitness was current and 
the vehicle was licensed until 1 September 2014.  
3.3.3.  The low -loading heavy trailer had an adjustable deck height and deck width .  It had been  
completely overhauled in December 2013.  The  14.55 -metre -long trailer had three axles with 
eight tyres on each axle.  The trailer had a current certificate of fitness and was licensed until 
12 August 2014.  
3.3.4.  It was fitted with a hydraulic suspension system that allowed for either side to be lifted or 
lowered to a height set by the driver .  The operating height of the trailer at the time of the 
accident could not be established  due to a disruption of the hydraulic lines caused by t he 
collision .

3.4.1.  Sunrise at Rangiriri was at 0703 o n 27 February 2014 .  The weather was fine and clear when 
the accident occurred at about 094 2.  At that time the sun's azimuth12 was 76.3 degrees at an 
altitude13 of 30.81 degrees.  On -site observation confirmed that the driver's sighting of the train 
was unlikely to have been compromised by glare from the sun.  
3.5. Personnel  
The train driver  
3.5.1.  The train driver had been employed by KiwiRail and its predecessors for almost 40 years.  He 
had been driving freight and passenger trains for all but one year of his employment.  His 
certification was current at the time of the accident.  
3.5.2.  The driver's post -accident drug and alcohol test produced  a negative  result . 
The tru ck driver  
3.5.3.  The truck driver had  had two work periods with Porter Haulage, having been re -employed on 2 
September 2013.  He had no known health issues at the time of the accident and no issues 
were noted on his pre -employment questionnaire .  He had completed  a driver assessment at 
the start of his first period of employment.   
3.5.4.  The truck  driver held a current driver's licence for the class of vehicle he was driving .  His 
primary duties included the transport of heavy construction equipment such as bulldozers, 
excavators, forklifts, graders, loaders and rollers.   He was also qualifi ed to drive heavy motor 
vehicle combinations over weight -restricted bridges without the need for an  accompanying 
certified pilot.

 3.5.5.  Soon after arriving at work at 054314 he had checked his truck  and then  discussed his work 
schedule with the dispatcher , who noted nothing unusual in the driver's demeanour.  He 
departed from his workplace at 0616 .  
3.5.6.  There was no activity on the truck driver's mobile phone at the time of the collision.   Post-
accident tests revealed  no evidence of alcohol or other performance -impairing substances . 
                                                        
14 The truck driver's work schedule was determined from a combination of workplace security cameras and 
the truck's vehicle management system.

 Final report RO -2014 -101 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  During 2013 and 2014 there was a total of 35 recorded train/motor vehicle collisions on public 
level crossings, resulting in eight fatalities.  
4.1.2.  Of the 1,320 public road level crossings on the national rail network , 425 (32 %) are protected 
by flashing lights and bells and 280 (21 %) are protected by half -arm barriers plus flashing lights 
and bells.  The other 615  public road level crossings  are protected by passive signs .  The Te 
Onetea Road  level crossing was a public level crossing protected by a passive ' STOP ' sign.  
4.1.3.  Statistics show that t he installation  of active protection at public road level crossings does  not 
eliminate train /motor vehicle collisions  at level crossings .  KiwiRail's records showed that in the 
10-year period before this accident , 12% of all level crossing collisions had occurred at 
crossings protected by half-arm barriers and flashing lights and bel ls, and 37 % of the collisions 
had occurred at level crossings that were protected by  flashing lights and bells  (49% for all 
crossings installed with active protection) . 
4.1.4.  The Railways Act 2005 g ives rail vehicles the right of way over road vehicles at level crossings.  
The train's event recorder showed that at the time of the accident the driver was complying with 
operating procedures .   
4.1.5.  The National Rail System Standard  6, Engineering Interoperability , require s that locomotive -
hauled passenger trains be able to stop within a distance of 750 metres when travelling at a 
speed of 100 kilometres per hour.  Data download ed from the train event recorder showed that 
at the time of the accident the train was travelling at 85 kilometres per hour when the driver 
made a full service brake applicatio n.  The train was brought to a stop within 430 metres.  The 
train braking performance and handling of the train did not  therefore  contribute to the accident.   
4.1.6.  The road vehicle was examined by a qualified inspector at a secure facility the following day.  No 
faults were found on either the semi -trailer or the driving unit .  It is considered unlikely  that a 
defect in either unit  contribute d to the accident , although the disruption to the truck as a result 
of the collision meant the possibility could not b e excluded.  
4.1.7.  The analysis discusses  what happened and the likely reasons for the collision occurr ing at the 
Te Onetea Road  public level crossing . 
4.1.8.  The analysis also considers the following safety issues : 
 there was  an insufficient sighting distance along the rail corridor available to a driver of a 
long vehicle to cross the Te Onetea Road  public level crossing  safely  from the west side  
 the road profile for the eastbound approach to the Te Onetea Road public level crossing 
did not allow the safe crossing of a road -compliant  truck and semi -trailer combination  
without the vehicle  becoming stuck . 
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  When the train was about 500 metres from the Te Onetea Road  level crossing, it was travelling 
at the authorised curve speed of 85 kilometres per hour (23.6 metres per second) .  At this point 
the train driver first saw the truck  slowly approaching  the level crossing from his right -hand side.  
He maintained train speed as he negotiated the right -hand curved approach to the level 
crossing , expecting that the dri ver of the truck  would stop at the level crossing and wait for the 
train to pass.  
4.2.2.  When  the train was about halfway around the curve the driver saw that the truck  was still 
moving forward and was already obstructing the adjacent northbound track, so he soun ded the 
train's whistle to warn the driver of the truck that his train was approaching .  The whistle was 
sounded 11 seconds before reaching the level crossing.  
 
Final report RO -2014 -101 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.2.3.  Four seconds later , when  the train was 161 metres from the level crossing , the driver applied 
full service brak ing followed by emergency braking.  This was when the train driver saw that the 
truck was stopped with its left front wheel between the rails of the southbound track.  The 
witness marks on the road and level crossing and  the event reconstruction showed that  the 
trailer had grounded and the truck had become stuck.  
4.2.4.  This hypothesis is further supported by two furrows made in the loose ballast, consistent with 
marks made by a rotating tyre.  The location of the furrows was fi ve metres from the centre of 
the southbound track, which is similar to  the distance  between the front axle and the tandem 
driving axles on the driving unit.   
4.2.5.  The train collided with the truck seven  seconds later , travelling at 78 kilomet res per hour.  It 
struck with sufficient force to eject the 500 -kilogram engine 46 metres from the truck.  
4.2.6.  The driver too was flung from the truck , and from the lack of trauma signs within the truck cab  it 
appears likely that when the collision occurred he was standing outside the cab, possibly on the 
running board.  The driver's door was further evidence supporting this hypothesis.  When it was 
examined at the accident site the door latch was noted to be in the open position.   A more 
detailed examination  of the door 'catch ' and 'latch ' system was carried out by a qualified 
vehicle inspector the day after the accident.  The inspector determined that neither component 
had been forced, leading to the conclusion  that the driver had opened it before the collis ion. 
4.2.7.  It has not been possible to determine at what point the truck driver noticed the train, or whether 
he did  at all .  The possibility that he saw the train in the last seconds and was escaping the cab 
when it struck could not be excluded.  Equally howeve r, it would not have been  unusual for him 
to have left  the cab  to investigate his truck becoming  stuck on the level crossing.  
4.2.8.  The reconstruction showed that with the train travelling at 85 kilometr es per hour it would have 
been visible to the truck driver for 19 seconds before it reached the level crossing.  A n analysis 
of the timing of events show ed that the train would  have been visible to the driver when his 
truck reached the stop limit lines  at the level crossing . 
4.2.9.  The train headlight and the 'ditch ligh ts' were  alerting mechanisms that the driver may have 
noticed.  Equally, the sound of the whistle could have alerted the truck driver.  However, the 
post-accident examination determined that the truck windows were closed at the time.  The 
accident reconstruction showed that with the truck engine running and the windows closed , it 
would have been difficult for the driver to hear  the train whistle . 
4.2.10.  The accident reconstruction included two scenarios: stopping at the (stop) limit line  before  
entering the level crossing; and entering the level cr ossing without stopping .  The trailer's 
ground clearance was set at 200 millimetres to ensure that it passed over the level crossing 
without grounding and becoming stuck.   
4.2.11.  From a standing start at the  limit line it took an average of 14.3 seconds for the test vehicle to 
clear the level crossing.  When the test vehicle was driven across the level crossing without 
stopping at the limit line it took an average 9.2 seconds to clear the level crossing.  In the worst 
case scenario , if the train came in  to view just as the truck started to move forward , there was  a 
margin  of less than five second s for it to clear the southbound track .  This small margin for error 
is discussed in the following section.  
4.2.12.  The train driver observed that the truck did not stop before proceeding on to the level crossing.  
The road signage required that the driver stop his truck and look for trains before proceeding 
across the level crossing.  Complying with the road rules for veh icles stopping at stop signs will 
reduce the risk of an accident by giving drivers more time to look for trains, assess the situation 
and consider any risk before proceeding.  This is a key lesson arising from this inquiry . 
4.2.13.  The roadside 'level crossing ahead' warning  sign in the direction from which the truck was 
approaching the level crossing was missing.  However, this is unlikely to have resulted in the 
driver being unaware that he was approaching a level crossing.  The movement of a large 
vehicle down s uch a narrow road would have been slow, which is consistent with the train driver 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final report RO -2014 -101 observing the truck approaching the level crossing at a slow speed.  The missing sign is 
therefore not considered to have been a factor contributing to the accident.  
Finding s  
1. There was no mechanical issue with the train or any issue with the manner in 
which it was driven that contributed to the accident.  
2. There was no  pre-existing  mechanical issue found with the truck.  However, the 
extent to which it was damaged in the collis ion meant  it was not possible to 
exclude mechanical failure as a factor contributing to the accident.  
3. The train would have been visible to the truck driver when the truck reached the 
compulsory stop limit line at the Te Onetea Road level crossing.   
4. The dr iver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto 
the level crossing, where his trailer  grounded and the truck became stuck in the 
path of the train.  
5. It could not be established with any certainty whether the truck driver saw or 
heard the train in the seconds leading up to the collision.  However, it is almost 
certain that he had opened the driver door and was outside the cab when the 
collision occurred.  
6. There was adequate signage to warn the truck driver of the presence of  the ra il 
level crossing in time for him to stop his truck.  
 
4.3. Sighting distance s at the Te Onetea Road  level crossing  
Safety issue - The sighting distance available to drivers of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea 
Road  level crossing safely did not comply with the N Z Transport Agency's Traffic Control 
Devices Manual . 
4.3.1.  The Australian Level Crossing Assessment Model (ALCAM) is an assessment tool adopted by 
New Zealand used to identify key potential risks at level crossings and to assist in the 
prioritisation of level crossings for upgrade.  ALCAM is also used to assess co mpliance with the 
New Zealand Traffic Control Devices Manual.  The ALCAM process involves the collection of 
data through a combination of level -crossing surveys and train and road vehicle information 
from the respective rail and road authorities.  KiwiRail  operates the level -crossing data 
management system that allows for the effective management of the ALCAM data.  
4.3.2.  The most recen t ALCAM  site survey at the Te Onetea Road  level crossing had been  carried out 
on 20 March 2012 .  The survey had review ed the road traffic control measure s in place and 
measured and record ed various parameters that included the width of the road, the width of 
the railway  track s, the distance from the closest rail to the limit lines, the angle between the 
road and the rail way track , the road approach gradient  and the measured sight ing distances.   
4.3.3.  The survey data was used to calculate the minimum sight ing distance  that a motorist stopped 
at the level crossing and first seeing an approaching train would require in order to clear the 
level crossing safely ahead of the train.  The measured and calculated sight ing distances  were 
compared to determine whether any corrective action  was required .   
4.3.4.  Appendix 1 shows the procedure for calculating sighting distances at le vel crossings.   
4.3.5.  In the case of the eastbound  approach to the Te Onetea Road  level crossing  (the direction in 
which the truck was travelling) the calculated minimum restart sighting distance  required for a 
long vehicle (up to 23 metres long) to cross the double track safely was 599 metres.  However, 
the measured restart sighting distance  available for a train approaching on the southbound 
track (along which the train was travelling) was calculated at 482 metres .  As mentioned in the 
previous s ection, this gave only 19 seconds for the truck involved in this accident to pass over 
the level crossing once a train came in  to view.  
 
Final report RO -2014 -101 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.3.6.  The time available for a long vehicle to clear the level crossing for an approaching northbound 
train is less than for t hat of a southbound train.   The maximum available sighting distance in 
that direction was 327 metres .  The maximum speed for a northbound train approaching the 
level crossing was 95 kilometres per hour, or 26.4 metres per second.  This provid ed a 
maximum of 12.4 seconds for a vehicle to clear the level crossing  safely .  For the truck involved 
in this accident there would have been  insufficient time to clear  the Te Onetea  Road  level 
crossing from a standing start.   
4.3.7.  Neither of the measured restar t sighting distances met the minimum requir ements of the Traffic 
Control Devices Manual .  A fully road -compliant long vehicle could not therefore use the level 
crossing with the recommended margins for safety.   
4.3.8.  No remedial action to improve the view lines , decrease the speed s of trains passing over the 
level crossing, prohibit drivers of long road vehicles from using  the crossing  or warn them not to 
use it  had been  taken between the 2012 level crossing assessmen t and the day of this 
accident.  The road controlling authority said that that was because KiwiRail had prioritised 
other level crossings for remedial action, based on their having higher  risk score s.  The 
Commission has recommended that the chief executive of the N Z Transport Agency address 
this safety issue . 
Finding  
7. The sighting distances for road users of the  Te Onetea Road level crossing did not 
meet the minimum standards as set out in the NZ  Transport Agency's Traffic 
Control Devices Manual .  It was possible that fully compliant , long, heavy r oad 
vehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would have  had insufficient 
time to clear the level crossing from a standing start . 
 
 
4.4. The road profile     
Safety issue - level crossing assessments do  not require the  road  profile and the alignment of 
roads on the approach to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured .  Therefore 
there are no check s made to ensure that all road -legal vehicles can pass over level crossing s 
without becoming stuck . 
4.4.1.  The minimum ground clearance f or a heavy motor vehicle15 on New Zealand roads is the 
greater of 100 millimetres or  6% (60 millimetres per metre) of the distance from the nearest 
axle to the point where the ground clearance is measured.   For the truck involved in this 
accident  the distance from the trailer's leading axle to the low point of the trailer underframe  
was less than 1.66 metres , therefore a  minimum ground clearance of 100 millimetres applied.   
The truck complied with this requirement.  
4.4.2.  At the re construction  exercise t he trailer's ground clearance was lowered to the minimum 100 
millimetres and the truck  was driven onto the level crossing.  The underframe  in front of the 
trailer's leading axle came in  to contact with the road surface before the driving unit reached  
the southbound track .  Despite the driver applying more power , the truck could not be driven 
forward.

 4.4.3.  The gouge mark on the road surface (see Figure 10) had similar characteristics to the gouge 
mark identified  on the day of the accident.   
 
Figure 10 
Gouge mark on the road surface  (photograph provided by New Zealand  Police)  
4.4.4.  The reconstruction exercise showed that the trailer grounded and the truck became stuck on 
the level crossing when the trailer height was set at the legal minimum height of 100 
millimetres .  The exercise was repeated with  the ground clearance height set at 150 millimetres  
with similar results - the trailer grounded and the truck became stuck  (see Figure 8) .  Only with 
the minimum ground clearance height set at 200 millimetres (twice the minimum legal 
standard ) was the truck able to pass over the level crossing .   
4.4.5.  The Commission has raised the issue of road profile s over level crossings in a previous report 
(Commission report 11 -104)16.   
4.4.6.  In that report the Commission found that "the profile of the Beach Road , Paekakariki, level 
crossing and the adjacent section of road leading up to the intersection with State Highwa y 1 
were not well suited for long and low road vehicles ", and that "the bus [involved in that 
accident] complied with all aspects of the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass ". 
The same issue arose  with the Te Onetea Road level crossing.  
4.4.7.  The Commission also found that "changes in the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and 
Mass have been made with little formal consideration for the compatibility of long and low road 
vehicles with existing rail level crossings throughout New Zealand" . 
4.4.8.  It is possible that the Te Onetea Road level crossing is one that has been affected by changes in 
the allowable dimensions of long , low road vehicles.  Unless the profile s of all level crossings 
are assessed against the current allow able dimensions for long , low vehicles , the potential risk 
of this type of accident occurring will remain high.  
4.4.9.  The ALCAM survey measures the gradient of the road leading up to the level crossing, but does 
not measure the rate of change in gradient in order to record the profile or vertical alignment of 
the road for the purposes of ensuring that road -legal vehicles can use the level crossing safely  
and without becoming stuck.  
4.4.10.  It is important that rail level crossings are compat ible with road vehicles, or that road users are 
made awar e of limitations on the use of at-risk level crossings, in much the same way that 
driver s of over -dimension road loads are warned of low bridges and tunnels.

 Final report RO -2014 -101 4.4.11.  The Commission has made a recommendation to the chief executive of the N Z Transport 
Agency to addr ess this safety issue . 
Finding s  
8. The profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea 
Road  level crossing prevented the truck , set at a road -legal ground clearance 
height, passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck.  
9. There is no routine procedure for measuring the profile or vertical alignment of 
the road at rail level crossings, which means there could be other level crossings 
in New Zealand on which road -legal vehicles could become stuck.

 5. Findings  
5.1. There was no mechanical issue with the train or any issue with the manner in which it was 
driven that contributed to the accident.  
5.2. There was no pre -existing mechanical issue found with the truck.  However, the extent to which 
it was damaged in the collision meant it wa s not possible to exclude mechanical failure as a 
factor contributing to the accident.  
5.3. The train would have been visible to the truck driver when the truck reached the compulsory

5.5. It could not be established with any certainty whether the truck driver saw or heard the train in 
the seconds leading up to the collision.  However, it is almost certain that he had opened the 
driver door and was outside the cab when the collision occurred.  
5.6. There was adequate signage to warn the truck driver of the presence of the rail level crossin g in 
time for him to stop his truck.  
5.7. The sighting distances for road users of the Te Onetea Road level crossing did not meet the 
minimum standards as set out in  the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual .  It 
was possible that fully compliant , long, heavy road vehicles complying with the compulsory stop 
signs would have  had insufficient time to clear the level crossing from a standing start  
5.8. The profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road  level 
crossing pr evented the truck, set at a road -legal ground clearance height, passing over the level 
crossing without becoming stuck.  
5.9. There is no routine procedure for measuring the profile or vertical alignment of the road at rail 
level crossings, which means there cou ld be other level crossings in New Zealand on which 
road -legal vehicles could become stuck.

 Final report RO -2014 -101 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 20 March 2014 the chief operating officer of Porter Haulage stated in part:  
 a collaborative mee ting has be en held with Fletchers to reiterate and establish firm 
arrangements whereby Porter Group Haulage management and/or senior dri vers will 
inspect and agree on the suitability of he avy equipment and unloading sites  
 when loading off site e.g. on a pu blic road , suitable traffic management planning will be 
carried out by Fletchers  
 Porter Haulage staff have all participated in a briefing on the accident and have been fully 
informed of what is known about the accident  
 level crossing access and crossing information has been distributed to all driving staff and 
there has been a discussion to collect information on any other crossings considered to be 
hazardous  
 the heavy haulage ha zard register has been updated with additional i nformation on level 
crossings  
 all Porter Gro up drivers have been instructed to enter the KiwiRail emergency contact 
number(s) in their smart phones  so that KiwiRail can be advised of any emergency as soon 
as possible.  
6.3. On 18 March 2016  the NZ Transport Agency stated that KiwiRail's emergency number 0800 
808 400 had been included in NZ Transport Agency "level crossing articles" published recently 
or about to be published  in the following publications : 
 Road Transport Forum online newsletter, M arch 2016  
 Diesel Talk magazine, March 2016  
 Truck and Driver magazine, April 2016.

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the i dentified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to NZ Transport Agecy , with notice of 
these recommendations given t o KiwiRail and Waikato District Council.  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Recommendations  made to the NZ T ransport Agency  
7.3. A survey of the Te Onetea Road  level crossing was carried out to the ALCAM standards on  20 
March 2012.  The sighting distances in both directions did not allow sufficient time for long 
vehicles to drive safely over the level crossing  without being struck by a train .  Therefore, a fully 
road -compliant long vehicle could not use the level crossing with the recommended margins for 
safety . 
7.3.1.  No action had been taken betwe en the 2012 survey and the date of the accident, 27 February 
2014, to mitigate the risk to road users and train vehicles . The Commission recommends that 
the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and Waikato District Council 
to address this safety issue . (012/16)  
On 16 June 2016, NZ Transport Agency replied:  
In relation to Recommendation 012/16, the Agency intends to refer the sighting 
distance issue directly to the Waikato District Council and KiwiRail Holdings Ltd.  
We will do this at the earliest opportunity and will report progress back to the 
Commission.  
7.4. It is possible that the Te Onetea Road level crossing is one that has been affected by changes in 
the allowable dimensions of long , low road vehicles.  Unless the profile s of all level crossings 
are assessed against the current allowable dimensions for long , low ve hicles, the potential risk 
of this type of accident occurring will remain high.  
The ALCAM survey measures the gradient of the road leading up to the level crossin g, but does 
not measure the rate of change in gradient in order to record the profile or vertical alignment of 
the road for the purposes of ensuring that road -legal vehicles can use the level crossing safely 
without becoming stuck.  
It is important that rai l level crossings are compat ible with road vehicles, and that road users 
are made aware of limitations on the use of at -risk level crossings, in much the same way  that 
drivers of  high vehicles are warned of low bridges and tunnels.  
7.4.1.  The Commission recommend s that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with 
KiwiRail and all road controlling authorities to ensure that rail level crossing assessments 
include a measure of the road profile and compatibility with the allowable dimensions for long 
and low road vehicles . (013/16)  
On 16 June 2016, NZ Transport Agency replied:  
In relation to Recommendation 013/16, the Transport Agency is currently 
exploring options of how to best find a solution to addrss this safety 
recommendation.  
We will inform  the Commission once the Transport Agency has both determind 
and can detail the scope of what is required.
