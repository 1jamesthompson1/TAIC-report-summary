- name: Other
  percentage: 70
  explanation: The primary contributing factors to the accident were related to the road and level crossing design, which are not covered by the predefined safety themes. Specifically, the sighting distances at the level crossing did not meet minimum standards, which could have given the truck driver insufficient time to clear the level crossing (4.3.7). Additionally, the road profile prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, from passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck (4.4.8). These issues are related to infrastructure design and regulatory standards, which are not explicitly covered by the provided safety themes.
