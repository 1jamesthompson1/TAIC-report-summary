- name: Sighting Distances at Level Crossings
  explanation: Sighting distance is a critical factor for ensuring that drivers have enough time to see an approaching train and react accordingly to avoid a collision. In this accident, the sighting distances for road users at the Te Onetea Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards set out in the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual. The report states that "the sighting distances for road users of the te onetea road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards as set out in the nz transport agency's traffic control devices manual" (4.3.8). This inadequacy in sighting distance meant that "fully compliant, long, heavy road vehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would have had insufficient time to clear the level crossing from a standing start" (5.7), which is directly relevant to the accident as it contributed to the truck becoming stuck on the tracks.
- name: Road Profile and Vehicle Ground Clearance
  explanation: The compatibility of the road profile with the ground clearance of road-legal vehicles is essential to prevent vehicles from becoming stuck on level crossings. In this incident, the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing had a profile that prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, from passing over without becoming stuck. The report highlights that "The profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck" (5.8). This theme is relevant because the truck involved in the accident grounded due to the road profile, leading to the collision with the train.
- name: Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
  explanation: Adherence to traffic control devices, such as stop signs at level crossings, is crucial for preventing accidents. In this case, the truck driver did not stop at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, which resulted in the truck becoming stuck in the path of the train. The report clearly states, "The driver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, where his trailer grounded and the truck became stuck in the path of the train" (5.4). This theme is relevant as the non-compliance with the stop sign was a key factor in the accident's occurrence.
- name: Audibility of Train Warnings
  explanation: The ability of vehicle drivers to hear train warnings, such as whistles, is a significant safety factor. In this accident, it was uncertain whether the truck driver heard the train's whistle due to the truck's windows being closed and the engine running. The report mentions that "with the truck engine running and the windows closed, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle" (4.2.9). This theme is relevant because if the truck driver had heard the whistle, it might have alerted him to the approaching train, potentially preventing the accident.
- name: Active Protection at Level Crossings
  explanation: The presence of active protection measures at level crossings, such as flashing lights and barriers, can significantly reduce the risk of collisions. However, the report indicates that "the installation of active protection at public road level crossings does not eliminate train/motor vehicle collisions at level crossings" (4.1.3). The Te Onetea Road level crossing was only protected by a passive 'STOP' sign (4.1.2), and the accident demonstrates that passive signs alone may not be sufficient to prevent collisions, making this a relevant safety theme.
- name: Vehicle and Train Condition and Operation
  explanation: The mechanical condition of the vehicles involved and the adherence to operating procedures by train drivers are important safety factors. In this incident, there were no mechanical issues with the train or the manner in which it was driven that contributed to the accident, as "the train's event recorder showed that at the time of the accident the driver was complying with operating procedures" (4.1.4). Additionally, no faults were found on the truck that could have contributed to the accident (4.1.6). This theme is relevant as it confirms that the collision was not due to mechanical failure or improper operation of the train, focusing attention on other contributing factors.
