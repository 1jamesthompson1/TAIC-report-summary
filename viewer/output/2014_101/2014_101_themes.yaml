- name: Sighting Distances at Level Crossings
  explanation: Sighting distance is a critical factor for ensuring that drivers have enough time to see an approaching train and react accordingly. In this accident, the sighting distances at the Te Onetea Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards set out by the NZ Transport Agency's Traffic Control Devices Manual. The report states that "the sighting distances for road users of the te onetea road level crossing did not meet the minimum standards" (4.3.8) and that "it was possible that fully compliant, long, heavy road vehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would have had insufficient time to clear the level crossing from a standing start" (5.7). This indicates that the truck driver may not have had adequate time to react to the approaching train, contributing to the accident.
- name: Road Profile and Vehicle Ground Clearance
  explanation: The compatibility of the road profile with the ground clearance of road-legal vehicles is essential to prevent vehicles from becoming stuck on level crossings. In this case, the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing had a profile that prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, from passing over without becoming stuck. The report highlights that "the profile or vertical alignment of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea Road level crossing prevented the truck, set at a road-legal ground clearance height, passing over the level crossing without becoming stuck" (5.8). This issue directly contributed to the accident as the truck became immobilized on the tracks.
- name: Compliance with Traffic Control Devices
  explanation: Adherence to traffic control devices, such as stop signs at level crossings, is crucial for preventing collisions. The report indicates that the truck driver did not stop at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing, where the truck became stuck. "The driver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving onto the level crossing" (5.4). This non-compliance with traffic control devices removed the opportunity for the truck driver to observe the train and react, leading to the collision.
- name: Audibility of Train Whistles
  explanation: The ability of a road vehicle driver to hear an approaching train's whistle can be a vital warning to prevent collisions. However, in this incident, the truck's windows were closed, and with the engine running, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle. "The accident reconstruction showed that with the truck engine running and the windows closed, it would have been difficult for the driver to hear the train whistle" (4.2.9). This factor may have prevented the truck driver from becoming aware of the approaching train in time to take evasive action.
- name: Active Protection at Level Crossings
  explanation: The presence of active protection measures at level crossings, such as flashing lights and barriers, can significantly reduce the risk of collisions. However, the report notes that even with active protection, collisions can still occur. "Statistics show that the installation of active protection at public road level crossings does not eliminate train/motor vehicle collisions at level crossings" (4.1.3). While this crossing only had passive signs, the theme is relevant as it highlights the need for effective protection measures and possibly suggests that this crossing could have benefited from more active safety measures.
- name: Vehicle Inspection and Mechanical Integrity
  explanation: Ensuring that vehicles involved in collisions are mechanically sound is important for ruling out vehicle defects as contributing factors. In this accident, the truck was examined, and no faults were found that could have contributed to the accident. "The road vehicle was examined by a qualified inspector at a secure facility the following day. No faults were found on either the semi-trailer or the driving unit" (4.1.6). Although mechanical failure could not be entirely excluded due to the collision damage, the mechanical integrity of the truck was not identified as a contributing factor, focusing attention on other safety themes.
