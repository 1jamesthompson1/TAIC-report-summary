  \  \n4.1.1.  During 2013 and 2014 there was a total of 35 recorded train/motor vehicle\
  \ collisions on public \nlevel crossings, resulting in eight fatalities.  \n4.1.2.\
  \  Of the 1,320 public road level crossings on the national rail network , 425 (32\
  \ %) are protected \nby flashing lights and bells and 280 (21 %) are protected by\
  \ half -arm barriers plus flashing lights \nand bells.  The other 615  public road\
  \ level crossings  are protected by passive signs .  The Te \nOnetea Road  level\
  \ crossing was a public level crossing protected by a passive ' STOP ' sign.  \n\
  4.1.3.  Statistics show that t he installation  of active protection at public road\
  \ level crossings does  not \neliminate train /motor vehicle collisions  at level\
  \ crossings .  KiwiRail's records showed that in the \n10-year period before this\
  \ accident , 12% of all level crossing collisions had occurred at \ncrossings protected\
  \ by half-arm barriers and flashing lights and bel ls, and 37 % of the collisions\
  \ \nhad occurred at level crossings that were protected by  flashing lights and\
  \ bells  (49% for all \ncrossings installed with active protection) . \n4.1.4. \
  \ The Railways Act 2005 g ives rail vehicles the right of way over road vehicles\
  \ at level crossings.  \nThe train's event recorder showed that at the time of the\
  \ accident the driver was complying with \noperating procedures .   \n4.1.5.  The\
  \ National Rail System Standard  6, Engineering Interoperability , require s that\
  \ locomotive -\nhauled passenger trains be able to stop within a distance of 750\
  \ metres when travelling at a \nspeed of 100 kilometres per hour.  Data download\
  \ ed from the train event recorder showed that \nat the time of the accident the\
  \ train was travelling at 85 kilometres per hour when the driver \nmade a full service\
  \ brake applicatio n.  The train was brought to a stop within 430 metres.  The \n\
  train braking performance and handling of the train did not  therefore  contribute\
  \ to the accident.   \n4.1.6.  The road vehicle was examined by a qualified inspector\
  \ at a secure facility the following day.  No \nfaults were found on either the\
  \ semi -trailer or the driving unit .  It is considered unlikely  that a \ndefect\
  \ in either unit  contribute d to the accident , although the disruption to the\
  \ truck as a result \nof the collision meant the possibility could not b e excluded.\
  \  \n4.1.7.  The analysis discusses  what happened and the likely reasons for the\
  \ collision occurr ing at the \nTe Onetea Road  public level crossing . \n4.1.8.\
  \  The analysis also considers the following safety issues : \n\uF0B7 there was\
  \  an insufficient sighting distance along the rail corridor available to a driver\
  \ of a \nlong vehicle to cross the Te Onetea Road  public level crossing  safely\
  \  from the west side  \n\uF0B7 the road profile for the eastbound approach to the\
  \ Te Onetea Road public level crossing \ndid not allow the safe crossing of a road\
  \ -compliant  truck and semi -trailer combination  \nwithout the vehicle  becoming\
  \ stuck . \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  When the train was about 500 metres from\
  \ the Te Onetea Road  level crossing, it was travelling \nat the authorised curve\
  \ speed of 85 kilometres per hour (23.6 metres per second) .  At this point \nthe\
  \ train driver first saw the truck  slowly approaching  the level crossing from\
  \ his right -hand side.  \nHe maintained train speed as he negotiated the right\
  \ -hand curved approach to the level \ncrossing , expecting that the dri ver of\
  \ the truck  would stop at the level crossing and wait for the \ntrain to pass.\
  \  \n4.2.2.  When  the train was about halfway around the curve the driver saw that\
  \ the truck  was still \nmoving forward and was already obstructing the adjacent\
  \ northbound track, so he soun ded the \ntrain's whistle to warn the driver of the\
  \ truck that his train was approaching .  The whistle was \nsounded 11 seconds before\
  \ reaching the level crossing.  \n \nFinal report RO -2014 -101 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\
  \ 4.2.3.  Four seconds later , when  the train was 161 metres from the level crossing\
  \ , the driver applied \nfull service brak ing followed by emergency braking.  This\
  \ was when the train driver saw that the \ntruck was stopped with its left front\
  \ wheel between the rails of the southbound track.  The \nwitness marks on the road\
  \ and level crossing and  the event reconstruction showed that  the \ntrailer had\
  \ grounded and the truck had become stuck.  \n4.2.4.  This hypothesis is further\
  \ supported by two furrows made in the loose ballast, consistent with \nmarks made\
  \ by a rotating tyre.  The location of the furrows was fi ve metres from the centre\
  \ of \nthe southbound track, which is similar to  the distance  between the front\
  \ axle and the tandem \ndriving axles on the driving unit.   \n4.2.5.  The train\
  \ collided with the truck seven  seconds later , travelling at 78 kilomet res per\
  \ hour.  It \nstruck with sufficient force to eject the 500 -kilogram engine 46\
  \ metres from the truck.  \n4.2.6.  The driver too was flung from the truck , and\
  \ from the lack of trauma signs within the truck cab  it \nappears likely that when\
  \ the collision occurred he was standing outside the cab, possibly on the \nrunning\
  \ board.  The driver's door was further evidence supporting this hypothesis.  When\
  \ it was \nexamined at the accident site the door latch was noted to be in the open\
  \ position.   A more \ndetailed examination  of the door 'catch ' and 'latch ' system\
  \ was carried out by a qualified \nvehicle inspector the day after the accident.\
  \  The inspector determined that neither component \nhad been forced, leading to\
  \ the conclusion  that the driver had opened it before the collis ion. \n4.2.7.\
  \  It has not been possible to determine at what point the truck driver noticed\
  \ the train, or whether \nhe did  at all .  The possibility that he saw the train\
  \ in the last seconds and was escaping the cab \nwhen it struck could not be excluded.\
  \  Equally howeve r, it would not have been  unusual for him \nto have left  the\
  \ cab  to investigate his truck becoming  stuck on the level crossing.  \n4.2.8.\
  \  The reconstruction showed that with the train travelling at 85 kilometr es per\
  \ hour it would have \nbeen visible to the truck driver for 19 seconds before it\
  \ reached the level crossing.  A n analysis \nof the timing of events show ed that\
  \ the train would  have been visible to the driver when his \ntruck reached the\
  \ stop limit lines  at the level crossing . \n4.2.9.  The train headlight and the\
  \ 'ditch ligh ts' were  alerting mechanisms that the driver may have \nnoticed.\
  \  Equally, the sound of the whistle could have alerted the truck driver.  However,\
  \ the \npost-accident examination determined that the truck windows were closed\
  \ at the time.  The \naccident reconstruction showed that with the truck engine\
  \ running and the windows closed , it \nwould have been difficult for the driver\
  \ to hear  the train whistle . \n4.2.10.  The accident reconstruction included two\
  \ scenarios: stopping at the (stop) limit line  before  \nentering the level crossing;\
  \ and entering the level cr ossing without stopping .  The trailer's \nground clearance\
  \ was set at 200 millimetres to ensure that it passed over the level crossing \n\
  without grounding and becoming stuck.   \n4.2.11.  From a standing start at the\
  \  limit line it took an average of 14.3 seconds for the test vehicle to \nclear\
  \ the level crossing.  When the test vehicle was driven across the level crossing\
  \ without \nstopping at the limit line it took an average 9.2 seconds to clear the\
  \ level crossing.  In the worst \ncase scenario , if the train came in  to view\
  \ just as the truck started to move forward , there was  a \nmargin  of less than\
  \ five second s for it to clear the southbound track .  This small margin for error\
  \ \nis discussed in the following section.  \n4.2.12.  The train driver observed\
  \ that the truck did not stop before proceeding on to the level crossing.  \nThe\
  \ road signage required that the driver stop his truck and look for trains before\
  \ proceeding \nacross the level crossing.  Complying with the road rules for veh\
  \ icles stopping at stop signs will \nreduce the risk of an accident by giving drivers\
  \ more time to look for trains, assess the situation \nand consider any risk before\
  \ proceeding.  This is a key lesson arising from this inquiry . \n4.2.13.  The roadside\
  \ 'level crossing ahead' warning  sign in the direction from which the truck was\
  \ \napproaching the level crossing was missing.  However, this is unlikely to have\
  \ resulted in the \ndriver being unaware that he was approaching a level crossing.\
  \  The movement of a large \nvehicle down s uch a narrow road would have been slow,\
  \ which is consistent with the train driver \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO\
  \ -2014 -101 observing the truck approaching the level crossing at a slow speed.\
  \  The missing sign is \ntherefore not considered to have been a factor contributing\
  \ to the accident.  \nFinding s  \n1. There was no mechanical issue with the train\
  \ or any issue with the manner in \nwhich it was driven that contributed to the\
  \ accident.  \n2. There was no  pre-existing  mechanical issue found with the truck.\
  \  However, the \nextent to which it was damaged in the collis ion meant  it was\
  \ not possible to \nexclude mechanical failure as a factor contributing to the accident.\
  \  \n3. The train would have been visible to the truck driver when the truck reached\
  \ the \ncompulsory stop limit line at the Te Onetea Road level crossing.   \n4.\
  \ The dr iver did not stop his truck at the compulsory stop sign before driving\
  \ onto \nthe level crossing, where his trailer  grounded and the truck became stuck\
  \ in the \npath of the train.  \n5. It could not be established with any certainty\
  \ whether the truck driver saw or \nheard the train in the seconds leading up to\
  \ the collision.  However, it is almost \ncertain that he had opened the driver\
  \ door and was outside the cab when the \ncollision occurred.  \n6. There was adequate\
  \ signage to warn the truck driver of the presence of  the ra il \nlevel crossing\
  \ in time for him to stop his truck.  \n \n4.3. Sighting distance s at the Te Onetea\
  \ Road  level crossing  \nSafety issue - The sighting distance available to drivers\
  \ of long vehicles to cross the Te Onetea \nRoad  level crossing safely did not\
  \ comply with the N Z Transport Agency's Traffic Control \nDevices Manual . \n4.3.1.\
  \  The Australian Level Crossing Assessment Model (ALCAM) is an assessment tool\
  \ adopted by \nNew Zealand used to identify key potential risks at level crossings\
  \ and to assist in the \nprioritisation of level crossings for upgrade.  ALCAM is\
  \ also used to assess co mpliance with the \nNew Zealand Traffic Control Devices\
  \ Manual.  The ALCAM process involves the collection of \ndata through a combination\
  \ of level -crossing surveys and train and road vehicle information \nfrom the respective\
  \ rail and road authorities.  KiwiRail  operates the level -crossing data \nmanagement\
  \ system that allows for the effective management of the ALCAM data.  \n4.3.2. \
  \ The most recen t ALCAM  site survey at the Te Onetea Road  level crossing had\
  \ been  carried out \non 20 March 2012 .  The survey had review ed the road traffic\
  \ control measure s in place and \nmeasured and record ed various parameters that\
  \ included the width of the road, the width of \nthe railway  track s, the distance\
  \ from the closest rail to the limit lines, the angle between the \nroad and the\
  \ rail way track , the road approach gradient  and the measured sight ing distances.\
  \   \n4.3.3.  The survey data was used to calculate the minimum sight ing distance\
  \  that a motorist stopped \nat the level crossing and first seeing an approaching\
  \ train would require in order to clear the \nlevel crossing safely ahead of the\
  \ train.  The measured and calculated sight ing distances  were \ncompared to determine\
  \ whether any corrective action  was required .   \n4.3.4.  Appendix 1 shows the\
  \ procedure for calculating sighting distances at le vel crossings.   \n4.3.5. \
  \ In the case of the eastbound  approach to the Te Onetea Road  level crossing \
  \ (the direction in \nwhich the truck was travelling) the calculated minimum restart\
  \ sighting distance  required for a \nlong vehicle (up to 23 metres long) to cross\
  \ the double track safely was 599 metres.  However, \nthe measured restart sighting\
  \ distance  available for a train approaching on the southbound \ntrack (along which\
  \ the train was travelling) was calculated at 482 metres .  As mentioned in the\
  \ \nprevious s ection, this gave only 19 seconds for the truck involved in this\
  \ accident to pass over \nthe level crossing once a train came in  to view.  \n\
  \ \nFinal report RO -2014 -101 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.3.6.  The time available for\
  \ a long vehicle to clear the level crossing for an approaching northbound \ntrain\
  \ is less than for t hat of a southbound train.   The maximum available sighting\
  \ distance in \nthat direction was 327 metres .  The maximum speed for a northbound\
  \ train approaching the \nlevel crossing was 95 kilometres per hour, or 26.4 metres\
  \ per second.  This provid ed a \nmaximum of 12.4 seconds for a vehicle to clear\
  \ the level crossing  safely .  For the truck involved \nin this accident there\
  \ would have been  insufficient time to clear  the Te Onetea  Road  level \ncrossing\
  \ from a standing start.   \n4.3.7.  Neither of the measured restar t sighting distances\
  \ met the minimum requir ements of the Traffic \nControl Devices Manual .  A fully\
  \ road -compliant long vehicle could not therefore use the level \ncrossing with\
  \ the recommended margins for safety.   \n4.3.8.  No remedial action to improve\
  \ the view lines , decrease the speed s of trains passing over the \nlevel crossing,\
  \ prohibit drivers of long road vehicles from using  the crossing  or warn them\
  \ not to \nuse it  had been  taken between the 2012 level crossing assessmen t and\
  \ the day of this \naccident.  The road controlling authority said that that was\
  \ because KiwiRail had prioritised \nother level crossings for remedial action,\
  \ based on their having higher  risk score s.  The \nCommission has recommended\
  \ that the chief executive of the N Z Transport Agency address \nthis safety issue\
  \ . \nFinding  \n7. The sighting distances for road users of the  Te Onetea Road\
  \ level crossing did not \nmeet the minimum standards as set out in the NZ  Transport\
  \ Agency's Traffic \nControl Devices Manual .  It was possible that fully compliant\
  \ , long, heavy r oad \nvehicles complying with the compulsory stop signs would\
  \ have  had insufficient \ntime to clear the level crossing from a standing start\
  \ . \n \n \n4.4. The road profile     \nSafety issue - level crossing assessments\
  \ do  not require the  road  profile and the alignment of \nroads on the approach\
  \ to and passing over level crossings to be routinely measured .  Therefore \nthere\
  \ are no check s made to ensure that all road -legal vehicles can pass over level\
  \ crossing s \nwithout becoming stuck . \n4.4.1.  The minimum ground clearance f\
  \ or a heavy motor vehicle15 on New Zealand roads is the \ngreater of 100 millimetres\
  \ or  6% (60 millimetres per metre) of the distance from the nearest \naxle to the\
  \ point where the ground clearance is measured.   For the truck involved in this\
  \ \naccident  the distance from the trailer's leading axle to the low point of the\
  \ trailer underframe  \nwas less than 1.66 metres , therefore a  minimum ground\
  \ clearance of 100 millimetres applied.   \nThe truck complied with this requirement.\
  \  \n4.4.2.  At the re construction  exercise t he trailer's ground clearance was\
  \ lowered to the minimum 100 \nmillimetres and the truck  was driven onto the level\
  \ crossing.  The underframe  in front of the \ntrailer's leading axle came in  to\
  \ contact with the road surface before the driving unit reached  \nthe southbound\
  \ track .  Despite the driver applying more power , the truck could not be driven\
  \ \nforward.  \n                                                        \n15 Except\
  \ where a vehicle is loading or unloading.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report RO\

  \ characteristics to the gouge \nmark identified  on the day of the accident.  \
  \ \n \nFigure 10 \nGouge mark on the road surface  (photograph provided by New Zealand\
  \  Police)  \n4.4.4.  The reconstruction exercise showed that the trailer grounded\
  \ and the truck became stuck on \nthe level crossing when the trailer height was\
  \ set at the legal minimum height of 100 \nmillimetres .  The exercise was repeated\
  \ with  the ground clearance height set at 150 millimetres  \nwith similar results\
  \ - the trailer grounded and the truck became stuck  (see Figure 8) .  Only with\
  \ \nthe minimum ground clearance height set at 200 millimetres (twice the minimum\
  \ legal \nstandard ) was the truck able to pass over the level crossing .   \n4.4.5.\
  \  The Commission has raised the issue of road profile s over level crossings in\
  \ a previous report \n(Commission report 11 -104)16.   \n4.4.6.  In that report\
  \ the Commission found that \"the profile of the Beach Road , Paekakariki, level\
  \ \ncrossing and the adjacent section of road leading up to the intersection with\
  \ State Highwa y 1 \nwere not well suited for long and low road vehicles \", and\
  \ that \"the bus [involved in that \naccident] complied with all aspects of the\
  \ Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass \". \nThe same issue arose  with\
  \ the Te Onetea Road level crossing.  \n4.4.7.  The Commission also found that \"\
  changes in the Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and \nMass have been made\
  \ with little formal consideration for the compatibility of long and low road \n\
  vehicles with existing rail level crossings throughout New Zealand\" . \n4.4.8.\
  \  It is possible that the Te Onetea Road level crossing is one that has been affected\
  \ by changes in \nthe allowable dimensions of long , low road vehicles.  Unless\
  \ the profile s of all level crossings \nare assessed against the current allow\
  \ able dimensions for long , low vehicles , the potential risk \nof this type of\
  \ accident occurring will remain high.  \n4.4.9.  The ALCAM survey measures the\
  \ gradient of the road leading up to the level crossing, but does \nnot measure\
  \ the rate of change in gradient in order to record the profile or vertical alignment\
  \ of \nthe road for the purposes of ensuring that road -legal vehicles can use the\
  \ level crossing safely  \nand without becoming stuck.  \n4.4.10.  It is important\
  \ that rail level crossings are compat ible with road vehicles, or that road users\
  \ are \nmade awar e of limitations on the use of at-risk level crossings, in much\
  \ the same way that \ndriver s of over -dimension road loads are warned of low bridges\
  \ and tunnels.  \n                                                        \n16 Freight\

  \ has made a recommendation to the chief executive of the N Z Transport \nAgency\
  \ to addr ess this safety issue . \nFinding s  \n8. The profile or vertical alignment\
  \ of the eastbound road approach to the Te Onetea \nRoad  level crossing prevented\
  \ the truck , set at a road -legal ground clearance \nheight, passing over the level\
  \ crossing without becoming stuck.  \n9. There is no routine procedure for measuring\
  \ the profile or vertical alignment of \nthe road at rail level crossings, which\
  \ means there could be other level crossings \nin New Zealand on which road -legal\
  \ vehicles could become stuck.  \n \n \n  \n \nFinal report RO -2014 -101 \n<< Page\
