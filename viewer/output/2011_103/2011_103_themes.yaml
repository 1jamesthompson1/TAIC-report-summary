- name: Communication Plan and Procedures
  explanation: 'The communication plan and procedures are a critical safety theme in this incident. The initial communication plan agreed upon by the track ganger and the person in charge complied with KiwiRail procedures and likely would have prevented the incident ("A communication plan was considered by and agreed between the track ganger and the person in charge of the worksite. That initial plan complied with KiwiRail procedures and most probably would have prevented the incident" (5.7)). However, the amended communication plan increased the risk because the protection person could not see the work gang and it added an additional step using another means of communication ("The amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance operation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less likely to have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the work gang; and it added an additional step using another means of communication" (5.8)). The protection person''s failure to follow the amended communication plan was the final act that contributed to the incident ("The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed" (5.10)).'
- name: Planning and Coordination of Track Maintenance
  explanation: Planning and coordination of track maintenance work is another safety theme that played a role in this incident. The timing of the maintenance work was planned around the availability of the person in charge rather than optimizing efficiency with the least disruption to rail services ("The timing of the maintenance work was planned around the availability of the person in charge rather than optimising efficiency with the least disruption to rail services" (5.3)). Additionally, KiwiRail's system for planning track maintenance did not promote the coordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation, which could have reduced the risk of conflicts between maintenance gangs and rail vehicles ("KiwiRail's system for planning track maintenance did not promote the co-ordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation" (5.5)).
- name: Training and Certification of Maintenance Staff
  explanation: The training and certification of maintenance staff is a critical safety theme because KiwiRail's safety system could not ensure that infrastructure staff were competent to perform their roles. The track ganger and protection person had completed their Level C track protection theory training, but it could not be determined from KiwiRail's training records whether they had been assessed for and demonstrated competency in their respective roles ("Both the track ganger and the protection person had completed their Level C track protection theory training but it could not be determined from KiwiRail's training records whether they had been assessed for and demonstrated competency in their respective roles" (5.11)). This suggests that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day of the incident ("The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day" (5.13)).
- name: Use of Performance-Impairing Substances
  explanation: The use of performance-impairing substances is a significant safety theme because the protection person had been a regular user of cannabis, which is contrary to KiwiRail's drug and alcohol policy. Although it could not be determined if the protection person was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident, the use of cannabis by staff performing safety-critical tasks is of concern ("the protection person had been a regular user of cannabis, and subsequent testing confirmed that he had probably continued to use cannabis during the month following the incident" (6.1)). This issue is highlighted by the fact that the protection person did not follow the communication plan, which was a critical failure leading to the near miss ("The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed" (5.10)).
- name: Distraction from Personal Electronic Devices
  explanation: Distraction from personal electronic devices, specifically mobile phones, is a safety theme that emerged from this incident. The protection person was exchanging text messages with his partner around the time he was supposed to be protecting the safety of the work gang on the tracks, which could have distracted him from his duties ("The protection person cited personal circumstances that were distracting him at the time he was supposed to be protecting the safety of the work gang on the tracks. His mobile phone records do show that he was exchanging text messages with his partner around that time" (4.5.7)). Mobile phone use has been recognized as a major distractor in other accidents investigated by the Commission, and this behavior was evident in the protection person's actions during the incident ("Mobile phone use has proven to be a major distractor in other rail, air and marine accidents that the Commission has investigated" (4.5.9)).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures and Rules
  explanation: Adherence to safety procedures and rules is a safety theme that was not properly followed in this incident. The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence, leading to unclear roles and methods of operation ("The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence" (5.6)). Furthermore, the track ganger's decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority are indicative of a lack of adherence to established safety procedures and rules ("The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day" (5.13)).
