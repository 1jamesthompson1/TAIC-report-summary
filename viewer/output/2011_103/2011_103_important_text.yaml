  \ was the result of poor planning and poor communication - not just the \nplanning\
  \ for how the track repairs were to be achieved on the day, but KiwiRail's overall\
  \ \nprocess  for planning track occupations.  \n4.1.2.  The final event that resulted\
  \ in t he southbound passenger train nearly hitting the track \nworkers was the\
  \ protection person not following his instructions.  He was supposed to phone \n\
  his track ganger to check that the work party was off and clear of the tracks before\
  \ he told \nthe person in ch arge that the track was safe for a train to enter the\
  \ work area.  He did not do \nthis, and had not done so before the 2 earlier northbound\
  \ trains passed through the work \narea  on the adjacent line . \n4.1.3.  The analysis\
  \ of the data from the passenger train's event re corder confirmed that the train\
  \ \nwas travelling at the authorised line speed of 60 km/h at the time the driver\
  \ saw 2 track \nmaintenance staff working on the track about 90 m ahead , facing\
  \ away from his train.  The \ndriver had no more than 6 seconds to observe , analyse\
  \ and respond to what was in front of \nhim and then for the track staff to respond\
  \ and react.  The driver sounded the train horn  and \napplied maximum braking ,\
  \ and fortunately those working on the track heard the horn, turned \nand jumped\
  \ clear of the t rack just before the train passed.  \n4.1.4.  The situation into\
  \ which the protection person was put was less than ideal.  He had been \ngiven\
  \ the task of protecting a work group that he could not see, and every time a train\
  \ \nstopped at the compulsory stop board he was required to switch from using the\
  \ local radio \nchannel to using the mobile  phone th en back to using the local\
  \ radio channel  to confirm with \nthe person in charge that the work area was clear.\
  \  His situation was the result of an ad-hoc \ncommunication plan put together to\
  \ work around getting enough track occupation time to fix \nthe track duri ng a\
  \ period of high train frequency.  \n4.1.5.  Notwithstanding the less -than -ideal\
  \ communication plan, the protection person's task would \nhave been  achievable\
  \ had he followed the instructions given to him.  The factors that might \nhave\
  \ influenced his performance are discussed in the following analysis.  \n4.1.6.\
  \  Also discussed are the issues of planning occupations for track maintenance ;\
  \ \ncommunication ; procedures for protecting work areas ; training ; and the certification\
  \ process \nfor track maintenance staff . \nFinding s: \nThe near  miss9 between\
  \ southbound Train 622 5 and the 2 track workers occurred \nwhen the driver  was\
  \ given authori ty to pass through the worksite without the \nprotection person\
  \  first checking that the track workers were clear of the tracks.  \nBefore the\
  \ near  miss , the protection person  had given permission for  2 other \nnorthbound\
  \ trains  to pass  through the work area  on the adjacent line without first \n\
  checking that the track workers were clear of the tracks.  \n  \n              \
  \                                          \n9 A situation that did not result in\
  \ an accident, bu t potentially could have done so under slightly different \ncircumstances.\
  \   \n \n  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.2. Planning and procedures for protecting\
  \ work areas  \nWork planning  \n4.2.1.  KiwiRail's Track Code T00310 required the\
  \ out -of-gauge track to be inspected regularly until it \nwas fixed.  When the\
  \ condition was not fixed within 7 days, a temporary  speed restriction of \n60\
  \ km/h was required until it was fixed.  However, the wide gauge was located within\
  \ a \nsharp curve that was already permanently restricted to a maximum line speed\
  \ of 60 km/h , \nso there was no requirement to impose any further  speed restriction\
  \ . \n4.2.2.  Notwithstanding the existing speed limit for the curve , the Code\
  \ instruction to wait for 7 days \nbefore applying a speed restriction seemed unusual\
  \ .  If a speed restriction were  needed , \nlogic would say  that it was needed\
  \ immediately.  KiwiRail changed the Code on 1 November \n2011 , requiring an immediate\
  \ speed r estriction when such a  fault was detected.  \n4.2.3.  Twelve days went\
  \ by from the time the track fault was detected until the track  ganger was \ninstructed\
  \ to fix it.  The fact that the track where the fault was identified was already\
  \ speed \nrestricted meant there was time to plan for the repair to cause the least\
  \ disruption to trains \nand the work gang.  \n4.2.4.  Other work groups had been\
  \ working on the overhead traction the previous evening .  The \nsection had been\
  \  closed to all passenger trains to allow for that work, giving an ideal \nopportunity\
  \ for the track ganger to repair the over -gauge  fault without interruption.  Any\
  \ risk s \ncreated by trains and maintenance gangs competing for the same section\
  \ of track would \nhave been eliminated.  \n4.2.5.  Instead , the time and date\
  \ for making the repair were  based around the availability of the \nperson in charge.\
  \  This of course might have been a controlling factor, but no evidence could \n\
  be found that the planning team in Network Authorities  had considered combining\
  \ th e \nprotected work areas and protecting the 2 separate worksite s under Rule\
  \ 910  of the Code , \nMultiple Activities.  I t would appear that better planning\
  \ of track repair, maintenance and \ninspection by KiwiRail could result in operational\
  \ efficiency while also reducing the risk of \nconflicts between maintenance gangs\
  \ and rail vehicles.  \n4.2.6.  A copy of that previously approved track work protection\
  \ arrangement was appended to the \nApplication for Planned Work with 2 changes\
  \ : the term \"Overhead work \" had been replaced \nwith \"EM80 \" work and a new\
  \ alphanumeric call sign for the person in charge was shown.  \nHowever, t he Application\
  \ still referred to \"multiple work activities \" even though there was to \nbe\
  \ only one worksite  in the protected work area.  \n4.2.7.  KiwiRail's current work\
  \ application process and request forms were  set out in Semi -\nPermanent Bulletin\
  \ No. 532, dated 15 July 2011 .  The process required a minimum of 24 \nhours '\
  \ advance notice when making a request for minimal -impact work such as track re\
  \ -\ngauging at a multi -line site  (see Appendix 3).  An accompanying work area\
  \ communication \nplan was required when the work area was longer than one kilometre\
  \  and/or where there \nwas difficulty using the channel 1 or channel 5 radio frequenc\
  \ y to communicate with the \ndrivers of other rail service vehicles both within\
  \ and outside the protected work area.  The \nproposed North Junction -to-Paekakariki\
  \ work area satisfied both criteria in that the work \narea was 3.54 km long and\
  \ it was within an area  identified in KiwiRail's Rail Operating \nCode11 as an\
  \ area of poor coverage when using VHF hand -held radios.  \n4.2.8.  Despite  receiving\
  \ inaccurate and incomplete documentation without the required 24 -hour \nminimum\
  \ notice period, Network Authorities  approved the Application and included  details\
  \ of \nthe planned work on the information bulletin dated 25 August 2011, issued\
  \ at 1600 the \nprevious day.  \n                                              \
  \          \n10 Amended by significant Information Notice T039.  \n11 Section 10,\
  \ Clause 3.28.  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 14 >>\n Worksite protection  \n4.2.9.\
  \  The protection of staff and contractors working in a protected work area has\
  \ been an \nongoing safety issue  for KiwiRail.  Toolbox Topic No. 10058, issued\
  \ on 16 August 2010 , was \ndistributed to all workplaces for discussion.  Reference\
  \ was made to an earlier incident  that \nwas not dissimilar to this incident. \
  \ Staff were reminded to make sure that the line was clear \nbefore authorising\
  \ movements through a work area . They were to do this by advising all \nmaintenance\
  \ staff of the rail traffic and by receiving confirmation that all personnel and\
  \ \nequipment were  clear of the track.  The person in charge had to  give autho\
  \ rity before work \nresume d after the rail traffic had passed through the work\
  \ area.  This authority could be \ngiven face to face, by radio , by telephone or\
  \ by approved hand signals.  \n4.2.10.  The track ganger, the protection person\
  \ and the person in charge were working  for KiwiRail \nat the time the Toolbox\
  \ Topic was issued and were aware of its content.  \n4.2.11.  Between  1 July 2010\
  \ and 25 August 2011, KiwiRail  had reported 46 unauthorised track \noccupations\
  \  to the rail regulator,  the NZ Transport Agency .  Fourteen of these inciden\
  \ ts had \noccurred in protected work area s - where the track s had been  obstructed\
  \ after the person \npeople in charge had authorised train s to enter the work area\
  \ s.  A further 19 occurrences  \nhad involved contractor s working beyond the limits\
  \ of protected work a reas, or with no \nprotection.  Most of the unauthorised track\
  \ occupations had involved  major work areas \nwhere the people  in charge w ere\
  \ responsible for several worksite s in single protected work \narea s. \n4.2.12.\
  \  In response to these incidents KiwiRail engaged a  consultant  to review interface\
  \ \narrangements between KiwiRail and rail infrastructure service providers .  The\
  \ aim of the \nreview was to  come up with  training solutions  and provide recommendations\
  \ to improve \nworksite safety performance.  \n4.2.13.  The review primarily focused\
  \ on activities associated with managing access to the rail \nnetwork and how KiwiRail's\
  \ internal processes interact ed with and affected  large \nconstruction projects\
  \ currently underway within the Auckland rail network.  One of the key \nsafety\
  \ conclusions  from the review dated 5 September 2011 was:  \nWorkers are routinely\
  \ committing rule violations at large construction worksites \nas they attempt to\
  \ work around ineffective KiwiRail processes to minimise \nunnecessary delays -\
  \ as they see them.  \n4.2.14.  The review made  6 recommendations to address organisational\
  \ issues  that cause d delays at \nworksite s.  The recommendations were aimed at\
  \ giving  staff and contractors at worksite  \nlevel direct roles in reducing locally\
  \ controllable delays to reduce the incentives for rule \nviolations .  Four of\
  \ the recommendations had some relevance to this incident.  These are \nrepeated\
  \ below:  \nThat KiwiRail urgently reviews its construction planning and coordination\
  \ \nprocesses with the aid of an experienced rail sector consultancy and introduces\
  \ \ncurrent best practice.  \nThat KiwiRail introduces dedicated construction control\
  \ desks at National Train \nControl Centre for local construction work.  \nThat\
  \ KiwiRail identifies and introduces a radio communication facility for \nconstruction\
  \ in Auckland that works  over the entire length of long worksites and \nhas recording\
  \ of all voice traffic.   \nThat KiwiRail reviews and updates the processes and\
  \ technology used in \npreparing and distributing the daily Networks Operations\
  \ Information Bulletin.  \n4.2.15.  The role of protection person  was one that\
  \ had emerged within KiwiRail in answer to some of \nthe protection issues being\
  \ experienced at multiple worksite s.  At the time of this incident \nthere was\
  \ no formal recognition of the role, and no description of a protection person's\
  \  \nrespo nsibilities .  In September 2011 KiwiRail issued Semi Permanent  Bulletin\
  \ No. 792 ( refer \nSection 6.3).  The Bulletin formalised the site protector  and\
  \ defined the role and the \noperating certification required to become one.  T\
  \ he protection person for this incident  was \n  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 15\
  \ >>\n performing tasks similar to those of a site protector as defined in the Semi\
  \ -Permanent \nBulletin . \n4.2.16.  KiwiRail's procedures make no reference to\
  \ the positioning of the site protector in relation to \nthe worksite  that they\
  \ are  protecting .  While in some rare cases it might be that the \nprotection\
  \ person cannot remain in sight of the work gang while  still maintain ing radio\
  \ \ncontact with the person in charge , the procedures should make it clear that\
  \ this should be \nthe exception and stress the im portance of the protection person\
  \ being able to see the work \ngroup when making radio contact with the person in\
  \ charge.  H aving the work gang in sight \nwill reduce the probability of the system\
  \ failing, as it did on this occasion.  \nFinding s: \nThe timing of the maintenance\
  \ work was planned around the availability of the \nperson in charge rather than\
  \ optimising efficiency with the least disruption to rail \nservices.  \nThe Application\
  \ for Planned Work submitted by the track ganger was incomplete \nbecause it did\
  \ not include a communication plan, and it contained erroneous \ninformation.  The\
  \ work plan therefore should not have been approved by the work \nplanning group.\
  \  \nThe KiwiRail system for planning track maintenance did not promote the co -\n\
  ordination of separate jobs t o be done on the same section of track into one track\
  \ \noccupation.  \nThe protection person  was being used by KiwiRail to provide\
  \ protection for \nindividual worksite s within longer  work areas , but KiwiRail\
  \ had not formally \nincorporated th is work practice into its rules at the time\
  \ of this occurrence.  \nConsequently, the role and methods of operation were not\
  \ clear.  \n4.3. Communication  \n4.3.1.  Soon after the maintenance gang arrived\
  \ at Paekakariki, the person in charge and the track \nganger developed a comm unication\
  \ plan .  This initial plan followed the standard KiwiRail \nprotocols . \n4.3.2.\
  \  While developing the communication plan, the  track  ganger was also told that\
  \ there were  \nadditional non -revenue passenger trains operating throughout the\
  \ morning that would delay \ntheir start time by about 45 minutes , and that throughout\
  \ the day the gang  would have to \nclear the track for more trains than usual.\
  \  \n4.3.3.  The track ganger made use of the 45 minutes ' waiting to acces s the\
  \ protected work area by \nholding a pre-shift briefing with his work group.  He\
  \ explained the work programme for the \nday, and informed his team that they would\
  \ have to clear the track for more  trains than \nusual .  The a ppointed protection\
  \ person confirmed that he understood the communication \nplan and w as aware of\
  \ his responsibilities . \n4.3.4.  The communication plan then changed  with the\
  \ discovery of the equipment shortage.   The \namended communication plan that had\
  \  the protection person standing next to the stabled \nhi-rail vehicle was not\
  \ a good one .  He was at a  location that was farther away from the \nperson in\
  \ charge than the re -gauge site and therefore less likely to have good radio \n\
  coverage.   It would have been more logical for the track ganger to keep  the portable\
  \ VHF \nradio himself, or if that was going to interfere with his work, then have\
  \ someone  else stand \nbeside him with the radio.  \n4.3.5.  By starting the preparatory\
  \ work without having a channel 1 radio at hand, the track ganger \ndenied himself\
  \ the opportu nity to listen to the open radio channel communication between \n\
  the person in charge and his protection person and between the person in charge\
  \ and a \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 16 >>\n driver waiting to enter the protected\
  \ work area , or to even have a direct line of \ncommunication with the pe rson\
  \ in charge himself . \n4.3.6.  The amended  communication plan made the protection\
  \ person's role critical to the safety of \nthe work group - specifically, the mobile\
  \ phone call he was supposed to make  to the track \nganger to ensure that he and\
  \ his colleague were off  and clear of the tracks.  This system \nfailed twice \
  \ before the first southbound train  came around the curve because the protection\
  \ \nperson did not make the phone calls as required .  Two trains were allowed through\
  \ the work \narea without the track ganger's kn owledge.  This should immediately\
  \ have told the track \nganger that the communication plan was not working, and\
  \ work should have stopped until \nthe situation had been  resolved.  Even when\
  \ he and his co -worker were nearly hit by the \nsouthbound passenger train , he\
  \ still did  not contact the protection person, nor did he \ncontact the person\
  \ in charge to report the near miss.  \n4.3.7.  The near miss would  have been avoided\
  \ h ad the track ganger stopped the preparatory work \nafter the 2 northbound passenger\
  \ trains passed .  It also could have been avoide d had he \ndelayed the start of\
  \ the preparatory work until his 2 other workers returned from the stabling \nroad,\
  \ because one of them  carried a portable local channel radio .  Carrying out track\
  \ \nmaintenance  work with out having a radio  nearby create d an unnecessary  safety\
  \ risk . \n4.3.8.  Mobile phone records showed that between  0930 and 1019:13 (the\
  \ time of the near miss ) \nthe protection person  received 2 voice messages  from\
  \ his track ganger and 2 text messages \nfrom his partner.  He also sent 2 te xt\
  \ messages to his partner during that time.  The times at \nwhich the transmissions\
  \ were received and made were:  \nTime  From  To Type  \n1003:02  Track g anger\
  \  Protection person  Voice  \n1007:02  Partner  Protection person  Text \n1010:10\
  \  Track g anger  Protection person  Voice  \n1014:40  Protection person  Partner\
  \  Text \n1015:17  Partner  Protection person  Text \n1015:41  Protection person\
  \  Partner  Text \n4.3.9.  The mobile phone records also showed that between  1027:29\
  \ and 1035:02 the protection \nperson received 4 more text messages from his par\
  \ tner and he sent one to his partner.  \nThere were no other entries allocated\
  \ to the mobile phone used by the protection  person  \nbefore 1100.  \n4.3.10.\
  \  The mobile phone records confirmed that the protection person had made no  attempt\
  \  to call \nhis track ganger before  he told the person in charge on 3 separate\
  \ occasions that the track \nwas clear for a train to enter the protected work area\
  \ . \nFindings:  \nA communication plan was considered by and agreed between the\
  \ track ganger \nand the person in charge of the worksite .  That  initial plan\
  \ complied with KiwiRail \nprocedures  and most probably would have prevented the\
  \ incident .  \nThe amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance\
  \ \noperation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less\
  \ li kely \nto have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the\
  \ work gang ; \nand it added an additional step using another means of communication\
  \ .  It is a \nsafety issue that the amended communication plan still complied with\
  \ KiwiRail \nprocedures.   \nThe track ganger should have recognised that the amended\
  \  communication plan \nhad failed when 2 passenger trains had been allowed through\
  \ the work area on \nthe adjacent track without being contacted by the protection\
  \ person.  \n \n  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 17 >>\n The protection person did not\
  \ fol low the amended communication plan.  H e did \nnot, as required, phone the\
  \ track ganger to ensure  that he and his colleague were \noff the tracks before\
  \ allowing the train to proceed.  H is failure to do so was the \nfinal act that\
  \ contributed to the incident.  \n \n4.4. Training and certification for maintenance\
  \ staff  \n4.4.1.  On the day of the near miss  the track ganger was responsible\
  \ for a work group of 5, including \nhimself.  The other members of the work group\
  \ had rail track maintenance experience \nranging from 9 months to near ly 5 years\
  \ .  Three of the work group were  designated trainee \ntrack workers  and had not\
  \ been signed off with their Level C certification.  Level C covered all \ntrack\
  \ safety and protection rules, and was also a qualification needed to drive a hi\
  \ -rail \nvehicle on the track.  \n4.4.2.  Although the track ganger had been acting\
  \ in the role for almost a year, he had been \ninvolved with track maintenance for\
  \ about 7 years.  A review of his training records showed \nthat he had satisfactorily\
  \ completed the classroom theory content  for Level C on 18 \nNovember 2009 and\
  \ was therefore able to start practical on -the-job training.  However , it \ncould\
  \ not be established from KiwiRail 's training  record s whether  his practical\
  \ training had \nbeen signed off . \n4.4.3.  The training records showed that the\
  \ track ganger had attended a  Ganger skills train ing \ncourse during 2008 and\
  \ a Project Reset (Level C refresher) course the following year .  One of \nthe\
  \ prerequisite s for attending these courses was that the person had been sig ned\
  \ off with \nLevel C competency, so it is most likely that he had been signed off,\
  \ but the training records \ndid not show that.  \n4.4.4.  The Level C theory training\
  \ also covered preparing and submitting an Application for Planned \nWork .  The\
  \ track ganger said that th e Application submitted for the re -gauge work had not\
  \ \nbeen the first application he had made and that he was comfortable with the\
  \ submission \nprocess .  However, the errors and omissions  made with the submission\
  \ , and some of his \ndecisions made at the worksite , suggested a lack of training\
  \ and/or experience to undertake \nthe task, particularly with such an inexperience\
  \ d team.  \n4.4.5.  The track ganger adjusted his work plan in an effort to improve\
  \ productivity  after he was \nmade aware  of the additional train movem ents. \
  \ However, he did this  without properly \nthinking through  the protection of his\
  \ work group .  His plan was further exacerbated when he \nrealised that one of\
  \ his hi -rail vehicle s would have to wait for a time slot to return to \nPaekakariki\
  \ to collect more materials to  finish  the job . \n4.4.6.  KiwiRail's Signal Rules\
  \ did not permit hi-rail vehicles or other rail service vehicles to be \nstabled\
  \ on a runaway road.  The purpose of a runaway road was to divert train s away from\
  \ \nconflicting movement s if the train s overr an a controlling signal at \"stop\"\
  .  Had a southbound \ntrain overrun the down departure signal  at North Junction\
  \ it would have been directed \ntowards the hi -rail vehicle s stabled on the runaway\
  \ road.   A collision with the hi -rail vehicles \ncould have occurred.  \n4.4.7.\
  \  The protection person had progressed from a trainee track worker to a track worker\
  \ by \ndemonstrating competence in a limited range of on -the-job tasks and attending\
  \ a series of \nshort courses.  KiwiRail 's expect ation wa s that such p rogression\
  \ would occur  with 3 to 6 \nmonths ' work experience .  Because the  other  3 staff\
  \ in the work group had yet to achieve \nthat competency level , the track ganger\
  \ had no alternative but to allocate the protection \nduties to the track worker\
  \ (protection person).  However, it could n ot be established from \nKiwiRail 's\
  \ training records that the track worker had demonstrated competency in that task\
  \ . \n4.4.8.  The protection person had attended a Project Reset course in 2009\
  \ .  Again, a prerequisite \nfor attending that course was that the person had been\
  \ previously signed off with Level C \ncompetency, so it is possible that he had\
  \ been signed off, but the records did  not show that.  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page\
  \ 18 >>\n 4.4.9.  A review of the KiwiRail training records for the track staff\
  \ involved with this incident showed \nthat at the time they we re in some disarray.\
  \  Numerous records were not available or had \nbeen lost , so it was not possible\
  \ to tell who was competent to do what, or whether \nrevalidations and safety assessments\
  \ had been carried out.  This was true for the entire \ncountry - not just for Wellington\
  \ -based staff . \n4.4.10.  At the time of this incident KiwiRail had recently appointed\
  \ a dedicated  operational safety  \nco-ordinator  for each of the 3 regions.  Infrastructure\
  \ staff were  required to undergo safety \nobservations annually as a form of compet\
  \ ency check , then undergo theory and practical \nrevalidation s every 2 years.\
  \  For the central region , the operational safety co -ordinator  began \nsystematically\
  \ revalidating every infrastructure staff member to \"reset \" the system.  At the\
  \ \ntime of this draft re port he had completed the revalidation  task and was on\
  \ target  to \ncomplete the few outstanding safety observations by the end of the\
  \ calendar  year.  The \noperational safety co -ordinators for the northern and\
  \ southern regions were subsequently \nassigned to other roles and as a consequence\
  \ the  revalidation task is incomplete.  A \nselection process is underway to fill\
  \ the vacanc ies. The status of the train ing and train ing \nrecords in those 2\
  \ regions i s also unclear.  The Commission has recommended that the \nChief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport Agency address this safety issue  (see section 7.3 ). \nFindings:\
  \  \nBoth the track ganger and the protection person had comple ted their Level\
  \ C \ntrack protection theory training but it could not be determined from  KiwiRail\
  \ 's \ntraining records whether  they had been assessed for and demonstrated \n\
  competency  in their respective roles . \nKiwiRail's system for training and assessment\
  \ did not ensure on this occasion \nthat the track ganger and protection person\
  \ were correctly certified to undertake \nthe duties they were performing on that\
  \ day.  \nKiwiRail's safety system could not ensure that infr astructure staff were\
  \ \ncompetent to perform their role s, and could not ensure that the appropriate\
  \ \nsafety observations and revalidation s of current staff competency had been\
  \ \nundertaken.  \nThe errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required\
  \ \ncommunication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located  where\
  \ he \ncould not see the worksite ; and stabling hi -rail vehicles on a runaway\
  \ road \nwithout authority, are collecti vely suggestive that the track ganger was\
  \ not \nsufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on\
  \ the day.  \n4.5. Performance -impairing substances and other possible factors\
  \  \n4.5.1.  The personal and family issues of the protection person had been  known\
  \ to his colleagues in \nthe weeks leading up to the near miss .  Even though the\
  \ protection person was aware of \nKiwiRail's policy on drugs and alcohol , he had\
  \ not sought a referral for professional help that \nwould have been made available\
  \ through his empl oyer despite having admitted to KiwiRail \nthat he had been using\
  \ drugs \"for about 6 weeks\" before the incident  and on some \noccasions having\
  \ \"heavy sessions\".  The results from his follow -up drug test conducted \nabout\
  \ one month after the first test showed tha t he continued to use cannabis after\
  \ the \nincident.  \n4.5.2.  A forensic toxicologist  from the Institute of Environmental\
  \ Science and Research reviewed \nthe urine drug test results and made the following\
  \ comments:  \nThe THC acid level in the sample taken on 25/08/2011 was  \n99 ng/mL.\
  \  The creatinine level was 82 ng/mL.  \n  \nReport 11 -103 \n<< Page 19 >>\n The\
  \ creatinine level of 82 ng/mL indicates a very large amount of water had \nbeen\
  \ drunk recently - creatinine levels would 'normally' be over 200 and les s \nthan\
  \ about 2000 ng/mL.  \nBecause drug levels in urine concentrations will vary depending\
  \ on how much \nliquid has been drunk and collected in the bladder, creatinine is\
  \ used to get an \nidea of how dilute or concentrated the urine is.  Creatinine\
  \ is excreted at a fairly \nconstant rate.  \nWhen comparing 2 urine samples the\
  \ THC acid l evel is divided by creatinine \nconcentration and multiplied by 1000\
  \ to even out possible dilution differences.  \nA THC acid level in the urine of\
  \ 99 ng/mL is not unusually high and even t he \nnormalised level of 1200 ng/mL\
  \ is not uncommon in the samples we analyse \nhere at ESR.  \nWith THC acid in the\
  \ urine all that can be said is that he has used cannabis.  It \nis not possible\
  \ to say when he last used it or if he was potentially impaired by it.  \n4.5.3.\
  \  The use of performance -impairing substances in any form is a serio us issue,\
  \ more so when \nstaff are engaged in safety -critical tasks .  The protection person\
  \ was a user of cannabis .  \nAlthough it could not be established scientifically\
  \ that his performance wa s impaired by \ncannabis  at the time of the incident\
  \ he did have a detectable level of THC acid in his urine \nwhen he was tested after\
  \ the incident.  The Commission has made a  recommendation to the \nChief Executive\
  \ of the NZ Transport Agency to address this is sue ( see section 7 .4). \n4.5.4.\
  \  On 8 March 2011, in its report on a collision between a jet boat and a jet ski\
  \  (Transport \nAccident Investigation Commission, 2011) , the Commission made a\
  \ recommendation to the \nSecretary of Transport regarding substance impairment\
  \ in the maritime sector.  The \nrecommendation referenced persons in charge  of\
  \ any craft, but the same could apply to a \nperson who has responsibilities or\
  \ duties involving  safety -critical activities wi thin the rail \nindustry.  The\
  \ recommendation and the reply on behalf of the Secretary  of Transport are \nshown\
  \ below:  \nUntil legislation is made setting limits for and testing of alcohol\
  \ and other \nperformance impairing substances for recreational and commercia l\
  \ boat \ndrivers, the risk of alcohol -related accidents will be elevated.  \nIt\
  \ is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address  this safety issue by\
  \ \npromoting appropriate legislation to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol\
  \ \nand other performance impai ring substances for persons in charge of \nrecreational\
  \ and commercial craft, and supporting legislation to allow testing \nfor such levels\
  \ in these cases. (005/11)  \n4.5.5.  On 16 March 2011 the Manager Maritime and\
  \ Freight of  the Ministry of Transport replied to \nthe r ecommendation:  \nThe\
  \ recommendation is that the Secretary for Transport promote legislation to \nset\
  \ limits and establish a testing regime to address the risk of recreational and\
  \ \ncommercial boating accidents due to the use of alcohol or other performance\
  \ -\nimpai ring substances.  \nRecreational and commercial boating is one of three\
  \ areas of transport activity \nwhere no alcohol and drug limits or testing regime\
  \ yet exists.  The introduction \nof such a regime in any of these areas would be\
  \ a major policy decision for \ngovernment that would need to be informed by a thorough\
  \ understanding of \nthe problem and the policy options.  The Ministry therefore\
  \ intends to develop a \nreport to government on the feasibility of a compulsory\
  \ post -accident and \nincident drug and alcohol test ing regime for the aviation,\
  \ maritime and rail \ntransport sectors.  \nAccordingly, implementation of recommendation\
  \ 005/11 would only be \npracticable once the relevant policy work has been undertaken\
  \ by the Ministry, \nand then only if the results indicated that a drug and alcohol\
  \ testing regime is a \nfeasible option.  \n4.5.6.  Because the Ministry of Transport\
  \ has undertaken to develop such a feasibility report for \ngovernment on a compulsory\
  \ post -accident and incident drug and alcohol testing regime for \nthe aviation,\
  \ mariti me and rail transport sectors, the Commission has not made any new \nReport\
  \ 11 -103 \n<< Page 20 >>\n recommendations on this matter.  However, the Commission\
  \ notes that this proposed action \nfalls short of what the Commission has recommended,\
  \ that legislation should set maximum \nallowable le vels of alcohol and other performance\
  \ -impairing substances .  Post-accident  and  \n-incident testing on its own will\
  \ not act as a sufficient deterrent  unless there are \nconsequences . \n4.5.7.\
  \  The protection person cited personal circumstances that were distracting him\
  \ at the time he \nwas supposed to be protecting the safety of the work gang on\
  \ the tracks.  His mobile phone \nrecords do show that he was exchanging  text messages\
  \  with his partner around that time.  \n4.5.8.  Mobile phone use has proven to\
  \ be a major distractor in rail, air and marine accidents  that \nthe Commission\
  \ has investigated.  The danger has also been reco gnised and dealt with by \nrecent\
  \ changes in road legislation preventing the use of mobile phones while driving\
  \ road \nvehicles.  \n4.5.9.  In this circumstance , however, the pro tection person's\
  \ phone usage was interrupted by radio \ncalls from the person in charge.  These\
  \ radio calls would normally redirect one 's attention \naway from the mobile phone\
  \ and on  to the task in hand.  The fact that the protection person \nanswered those\
  \ rad io calls but then did not complete the required checks would suggest \nthat\
  \ his focus was not really on the job, but elsewhere for some reason.  \nFindings:\
  \  \nThe protection person had been a regular user of cannabis , and subsequent\
  \ \ntesting confirmed that he had probably continued to use cannabis during the\
  \ \nmonth following the incident.  It is not possible to determine if the protection\
  \ \nperson was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident.  Nevertheless,\
  \ t he \nuse of cannabis by staff performing safe ty-critical tasks is of concern,\
  \ and was \ncontrary to KiwiRail's drug and alcohol policy  at the time of the incident\
  \ . \nMobile phone use has proven to be a major distractor in other rail, air and\
  \ marine \naccidents that the Commission has investigated.  The danger has also\
  \ been \nrecognised and dealt with by recent changes in road legislation preventing\
  \ the \nuse of mobile phones while driving road vehicles.  \n \n  \nReport 11 -103\
