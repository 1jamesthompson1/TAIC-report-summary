- safety_issue: 'The Application for Planned Work submitted by the track ganger was incomplete because it did not include a communication plan, and it contained erroneous information. The work plan therefore should not have been approved by the work planning group.

- safety_issue: 'The KiwiRail system for planning track maintenance did not promote the co-ordination of separate jobs to be done on the same section of track into one track occupation.

- safety_issue: 'The protection person was being used by KiwiRail to provide protection for individual worksites within longer work areas, but KiwiRail had not formally incorporated this work practice into its rules at the time of this occurrence. Consequently, the role and methods of operation were not clear.

- safety_issue: 'The amended communication plan increased the risk to the maintenance operation because: the protection person with the radio was in an area less likely to have good radio reception; the protection person could not see the work gang; and it added an additional step using another means of communication. It is a safety issue that the amended communication plan still complied with KiwiRail procedures.

- safety_issue: 'The track ganger should have recognised that the amended communication plan had failed when 2 passenger trains had been allowed through the work area on the adjacent track without being contacted by the protection person.

- safety_issue: 'The protection person did not follow the amended communication plan. He did not, as required, phone the track ganger to ensure that he and his colleague were off the tracks before allowing the train to proceed. His failure to do so was the final act that contributed to the incident.

- safety_issue: 'The errors in the work plan submitted; the omission of the required communication plan; the decision to rely on a protection person located where he could not see the worksite; and stabling hi-rail vehicles on a runaway road without authority, are collectively suggestive that the track ganger was not sufficiently trained and experienced to be in charge of the work group on the day.
