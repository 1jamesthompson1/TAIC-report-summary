2011_103,007/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System Standard Executive in developing a National Rail System Standard that requires all rail participants to have drug and alcohol policies that: have zero tolerance of performance-impairing substances for workers engaged in safety-critical tasks; require post-incident and accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol; and require a system for rail workers to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace.,"The protection person was a user of cannabis. Although it could not be established scientifically that his performance was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident, he did have a detectable level of THC-acid in his urine when he was tested after the incident.
Under no circumstances should the performance of any rail worker performing any safety-critical task be affected by alcohol or drugs of any kind. "
