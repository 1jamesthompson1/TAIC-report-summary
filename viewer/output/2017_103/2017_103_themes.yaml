- name: Congested Track Layout
  explanation: 'The congested track layout within the approaches to Wellington Station is a safety theme relevant to this accident. The limited space in this area increases the risk of trains colliding, as identified in a previous report: "there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited space makes the track layout congested" (4.1.2). This congestion can lead to difficulties in managing train movements and increases the potential for accidents, especially in situations where a train needs to stop unexpectedly, as was the case in this incident.'
- name: Inadequate Risk Mitigation Measures
  explanation: Inadequate risk mitigation measures for the upgraded bidirectional track is another safety theme. The report points out that "a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station" (4.1.2). Specifically, when the line was upgraded to allow trains to run in both directions, the eight-meter separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not identified as a potential issue. This oversight contributed to the incident, as the train stopped in a location that misled the signalling system, indicating that the train had cleared the signal when it had not (4.2.3).
- name: Signalling System Limitations
  explanation: 'The limitations of the signalling system represent a safety theme in this accident. The incident was exacerbated by the signalling system''s inability to accurately display the train''s position to the signaller. The train stopping with its rear bogie within the eight-meter length of track between the insulated joint and Signal 39 caused the mimic panel to incorrectly show that the train had passed the signal: "Having passed over the insulated joint, the track signalling system displayed to the signaller on the mimic panel that the rear of the train had passed Signal 39, when in fact it had not" (4.2.3). This misrepresentation on the mimic screen led the signaller to believe the track ahead was clear, increasing the risk of collision.'
- name: Train Monitoring System Inaccuracies
  explanation: 'Inaccuracies in the train monitoring system BIOS are a safety theme linked to this incident. The driver''s decision to stop the train was influenced by a false indication of a brake issue: "a subsequent maintenance examination revealed no fault with the actual brake system, and an update of the train monitoring system bios resolved the high-brake-pressure reading" (4.2.1 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The incorrect reading from the BIOS system led to the train stopping in a problematic location, which in turn contributed to the potential collision scenario.'
- name: Driver's Response to Perceived Brake Issues
  explanation: 'The driver''s response to perceived brake issues is a safety theme that played a role in this incident. The driver correctly prioritized safety by stopping the train to check the brakes upon perceiving that they were ''dragging'': "Train brakes are a safety-critical system and the driver was right to check them on departure from the platform" (4.2.2). However, the location where the train stopped due to this action inadvertently created a situation where the signalling system was misled, highlighting the need for better protocols or systems to handle such stops without compromising safety.'
- name: Insufficient Identification of Potential Issues During Upgrades
  explanation: 'The insufficient identification of potential issues during upgrades to the rail system is a safety theme evident in this accident. When the line was upgraded to bidirectional, the separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not recognized as a potential problem: "when the line was upgraded to bidirectional, the eight-meter separation between the insulated joint and the signal was not identified as a potential issue" (4.1.2 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This oversight suggests a gap in the risk assessment process during upgrades, which can lead to safety-critical situations as seen in this incident.'
