The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports shoul d be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any re commendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. At about 1810 on 15 May 2017, a loaded metropolitan passenger train departed Wellington 
Station bound for Waikanae.  The driver thought there was an issue with the train brakes, so 
stopped the  train within the approaches to Wellington  Station.  After a dis cussion with 
maintenance staff, it was decided to return the train to Wellington S tation.  
1.2. The train was under the control of a  signal box operator (signaller).  The signaller referred to the  
mimic screen2 and noted that it was showing the train occupying a single section of track 
between S ignals 37 and 39.  However, the rear of the train had not quite passed S ignal 39.  It 
had cleared an insulat ed joint in the rail that marked the end of one section and the start of the 
next on the signaller's mimic screen, but the insulat ed joint was eight metres away from the 
actual signal.  The rear of the train had come to rest between the insulated joint and the actual 
signal.  
1.3. The signaller planned to use Signal 39 to hold the train u ntil an other  inbound train was clear .  
However, when the driver changed driving ends, Signal 39 was just behind the  driving cab.  
When the signaller authorised the driver to proceed back to Signal 39, the driver moved the  
train forward in search of the sig nal, towards the same  set of crossover points as the other 
inbound train.  
1.4. No sooner had the train begun moving  than  it crossed back over the insulated joint in the rail.  
The signaller saw on the  mimic screen that the train had passed Signal 39 and was heading 
towards the in bound train.  The signaller called the driver to stop the  train.  The train stopped 
about 120 metres past the red signal.  There was no collision and nobody was injured.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission  (Commission)  found  that the situation was 
created because the signalling system was giving information to the signaller that did not match 
what was happening in the field.  The eight -metre separation between the signal and the 
insulated joint had not been identified as an i ssue when the lines in the area were modified and 
upgraded in 2010.  
1.6. The Commission identified two safety issues  that had been identified in a previous inquiry:  
• there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
becau se limited space makes the track layout congested  
• a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains 
colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station.  
1.7. The issues were also relevant to this inquiry .  As recommendations had already been made to 
address the safe ty issues, no new recommendations have been made.  
1.8. The k ey safety lesson  arising from this accident is  that trains should not be unnecessarily 
authorised to proceed up to red signals in congested areas, because the r educed safety 
margins in these areas increase the risk of a collision if a  signal is passed at danger .

 Final Report RO -2017- 103 2. Conduct of the inquiry   
2.1. The incident occurred on Monday 15  May 201 7 at 1815 .  The NZ Transport Agency notified the 
Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) soon after the incident occurred.   
The Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport Accident Investigation 
Commission Act 1990 to determine the circumstances and causes of the occurrence , and 
appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. On Wednesday 17 May  2017 , Commission investigators started  the site investigation  with  a re-
enact ment  of the incident to determine the position of the train in relati on to the track and 
signalling equipment . 
2.3. Commission investigators interviewed the:  
• train drive r 
• signal ler on duty at the time of the incident  
• driver who had driven the same Matangi train  prior to the incident  
• platform maintainer3 
• signals engineer . 
2.4. The C ommission obtained the following documents and records for analysis:  
• the closed -circuit television  (CCTV ) recordings from the camera s on board the train 
• the signals data downloaded from the Wellington Station signalling system  
• the training records of and  medical details for the train driver  
• the historical 'signal passed at danger'4 (SPAD) data for the Wellington Station area  
• the Tranzlog5 data from the train  
• the recordings from  the Wellington signal box  Channel 1 radio communications 
between the train  driver  and the signal ler for the time period of the  incident .  
2.5. On 23 May 2018 the Commissioners considered a draft report and approved it to be sent to 16 
interested persons for consultation.  
2.6. Two submissions were received.  The Commission considered the s ubmissions, and changes as 
a result of those submissions have been included in the final report . 
2.7. On 24 August 2018 the Commission approved the final report for publication .

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 15 May 2017 t he driver boarded the train a pproximately 10  minutes before its scheduled 
1800 departure  from Wellington , bound for Waikanae .  The driver  check ed the cab 
maintenance logs for any issues.  
3.1.2.  The driver noticed that the platform maintainer6 was in the rear of the cab investigating a n 
apparent brake fault  that  the previous driver  had reported.  The train monitoring s ystem7 screen 
was showing  an exces sively high brake gauge reading  for the rearmost bogie8 (see Figure 2).  In 
spite of this , the previous driver had state d that  the brakes had operat ed normally . 
 
Figure 2  
Train monitoring system screen in a sample Matangi train cab  
3.1.3.  The platform maintainer  tested the train at the platform and concluded that the high reading of 
700+KP a was not possible to a chieve .  The new driver was informed  that  the train was fit for 
service and that  the problem was most likely a sensor fault .  The platform maintainer  planned 
to remove the two -car set9 from service for further investigation at the maintenance depot once 
the train  returned to Wellington  later that evening . 
3.1.4.  Shortly  after the train departed the platform , the driver put the train power/brake handle into 
'Coast' (no power or brake  applied ) in order to check  that the brakes on the rear bogie were no t 
dragging.  The driver felt that the speed of the train slowed , so concluded that the brake s were 
dragging . 
3.1.5.  The driver felt it unwise to take the train to Waikanae and back in that condition, so  stopped the 
train and radio ed th e signaller  to advise that there appeared to be an issue with the train 
brakes.  The driver intended to seek ad vice from the platform maintainer  before proceeding any 
further.  The signaller acknowledge d this and awaited further details.  
3.1.6.  The driver contacted the platform maintainer by mobile phone .  They discussed whether the 
driver could exit the train  and walk back to  cut out the brakes on the affected bogie .  However ,

9 Each Matangi train is made up of two individual carriage s permanently joined by a flexible coupling.  The 
two cars are the FP ( powered - north end) and FT (t railer - south end).  These two -car sets can be joined 
together to make  a longer train up to an eight -car set .

 Final Report RO -2017- 103 because it was dark and the train was stopped on a main line during  a busy period , the driver 
did not feel it was safe to do so.   They both then agreed that the train should re turn to 
Wellington Station where the problem could be addressed . 
3.1.7.  The driver radio ed the signaller to explain that the train  needed to r eturn to the s tation.  The 
signaller looked at  the mimic screen and noted that it show ed the train occupying the section  of 
track north of  Signal 39 (see Figure 3) .  The signaller planned to  use Signal 39  to authorise the 
train s outh back to the s tation .  
 
Figure 3 
Extract from mimic screen in Wellington signalbox  
 
3.1.8.  The signaller confirmed to  the driver that the train had passed beyond Signal 39 , and that t he 
driver was to change driving ends  in readiness for the move back to the platform.  However, 
when the train had stopped, the rear of the train was about four metres short of going passed 
past Signal 39 (see Figure 4).  The insulated joint10 in the track that marked the end of one 
section and the beginning of the next section of track was eight metres behind the signal.  
Because the train had passed over this insulated joint, the signalling system indicated to the 
signaller that the train had passed north of Signal 39 and fully entered the next section of track 
on the mimic screen.  
3.1.9.  The drive r walked  through the congested  train, answering pa ssengers ' questions on the way .  It 
was dark outside and the brightly lit  interior of the  train made it difficult for the driver to  see 
anything outside.  The driver  took  a mom ent to update the t rain manage r, who then made a n 
announcement to the passengers o ver the public -address  system  that the train was returning to

 the station  platform .  Once the driver had changed ends, Signal 39 was about four metres 
behind the driving cab outside the driver 's forward view.  
3.1.10.  The driver contacted the signaller .  The signaller authorised the driver to "come around to the 
signal".  The signaller was referring to Signal 39 and the driver correctly understood that the  
train  could move  as far  as Signal 39 .  Signal 39 was set to 'All Red - Stop'. 
 
Figure 4 
Photograph showing position of the rear of the train in relation to Signal 39  
 
3.1.11.  Not realising th at the train was already pas t Signal 39 , the driver move d the train in the 
direction of the Wellington  Station platform looking for  the signal .  Once on the move , the driver 
talked on the radio with the  signaller regarding the options for the passengers back at the 
platform . 
3.1.12.  Shortly afte r having this conversation , the signaller noticed th at the mimic screen  indicated the 
returning train had entered the section of track south of Signal 39, and was on a potential 
collision course with another train travelling in the same direction on the adjacent Down Main 
Line.  The  two trains were travelling towards the same set of crossover points ahead . 
3.1.13.  The signaller called the train to " stop, stop, stop".   The driver stopped the train 121.7 metres 
past Signal 39.  
3.2. Key personnel  
3.2.1.  The train driver was employed by Transdev  Wellington Limited (Transdev)  and based at 
Wellington.  At the time of the incident the driver  had 12 years ' experience driving passenger 
trains on the Wellington network , held current certification and had a clean driving record.  In 
accordance with Tran sdev's  policy, t he driver underwent a post -incident drug and alcohol test, 
which came back negative (clear).    
3.2.2.  KiwiRail' s initial ass essment  was that the driver had passed Signal 39 at red.  Based on that 
assessment , it did not require either the signaller  or the platform maintainer to undergo a post -
incident drug and alcohol test.   The signaller was employed by KiwiRail and had 12 years ' 
signalling experience, the previous  six years split between the National Train Control Centre and 


<< Page 6 >>
 Final Report RO -2017- 103 the Wellington signal box.  The signaller  had an incident -free record and held current 
certification  at the time of the incident.  
3.2.3.  The platform maintainer was employed by Transdev , had six years ' experience maintaining the 
Matangi fleet in Wellington  and held current certification  for the role .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The incident resulted in a potential collision with another passenger train in the approaches to 
Wellington Station.  The area is subject to a permanent speed restriction of 20 kilometres per 
hour .  Nevertheless, a potential collision between two loaded passenger trains is a serious 
issue.  
4.1.2.  This analysis discusses what happened and then the following safety issue s that have been 
identified in  a previous report  published by the Commission11: 
• there is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
because limited space makes the track layout congested  
• a number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains 
colliding in the ap proa ches to Wellington Station .  When the line was upgraded to 
bidirectional12, the eight -metre separation between the insulated joint and the signal was 
not identified as a potential issue.  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  The incident sequence began when the driver elected to stop the  train owing to a perception 
that the brakes on the last carriage were 'dragging' (partially applied).  A s ubsequent 
maintenance examination revealed no fault with the actual brake system, and an update of the 
train m onitoring s ystem BIOS13 resolved the high-brake -pressure reading.  
4.2.2.  It is about as likely as  not that the apparent dragging the driver felt was caused by resistance  as 
the rear of the train ran through set s of points.  Train brakes are  a safety -critical system and the 
driver was right to check them on departure from the platform . 
4.2.3.  The problem arose because  the train stopped with its  rear bogie positioned within the eight -
metre length  of track between th e insulated joint and Signal 39 .  The location was unfortunate.  
Having passed over the insulated joint, the track signalling system displayed to the signaller on 
the mimic panel that the rear of the train had passed Signal 39, when in fact it had not.  The 
mimic screen  showed  the signaller that the train had stopped somewhere within the 368 -metre 
section of track between Signal 39 and the next signal  (see Figure 5).  The signaller had no 
reason to doubt the accuracy of the information being presented on  the mimic screen.

4.2.4.  After  chang ing driving ends , the driver  did not notice that Signal 39 was just behind the driving 
cab.  The driver would have walked past the signal while walking  through  the train, stopping to 
convers e with the train manager and answer some  passengers' questions.   In response to the 
signaller's instruction to " come around " to Signal 39, the driver moved the  train s outhward in a 
potential conflicting movement with another passen ger train heading into Wellington  Railway 
Station .  
4.2.5.  Fortunately the signaller saw on the  mimic screen that the train had entered the next track 
secti on, and radioed the driver  to stop.  
4.3. Signalling system  
Safety issue - There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington 
Station because limited space makes the track layout congested .  When the line was u pgraded 
to bidirecti onal14, the eight -metre  separation between  the insulat ed joint and the signal was not 
identified as a potential issue.  
4.3.1.  KiwiRail signallers, drivers and signals engineers spoken to all confirmed their understanding 
that a train being 'clear of a signal' meant that the whole train had moved pas t the physical 
signal post and that the signal would then be visible to a driver operating from the other end of 
the train.  
4.3.2.  When Signal 39 was installed , the track was dedicated to  train s travelling inbound to 
Wellin gton.   As part of a significant project to increase capacity into and out of Wellington 
Station in 2010, a third main line was added and the now middle main track was made 
bidirectional.  This allowed trains to be routed along the middle main track either outbound 
from or inbound to Wellington depending on demand.  The insulated joint associated with Signal 
39 was modified and a TrainStop15 installed  as part of the project . 
4.3.3.  Signal 39 is protected by a Train Stop for inbound Wellington trains .  The device was installed 
next to the signal and was designed to activate the brakes of an inbound train  automatically  if it 
passe d the signal at red .  It is a means of protecting the busy and congested approaches to 
Wellington Station from  trains that d o not stop at red signals .  The device works via  a lever that 
is raise d when the signal is at red and the last set of train wheels has passed over the insulated 
joint associated with the signal .  This raised lever catches on a trip lever device mounted on the

any part  of the train that was overhanging the last set of wheels would not catch on the raised  
TrainStop lever and damage the device  (see Figure 7).

4.3.5.  In its report on another potential collision in the vicinity of Wellington Railway Station  (Inquiry 
RO-2016 -101)16, the Commission noted the safety issue of the heightened risk of trains 
colliding within the approaches to Wellington S tation because limited space makes the track 
layout congested.

 4.3.6.  In response to a recommendation from the Commission , KiwiRail agreed to develop a long -term 
strategy for improving the safety of the track and infrastructure in the Wellington Station area.  
4.3.7.  In response to this incident, KiwiRail has modified  the signalling system at Signal 39 and similar 
signals in the Wellington area  (see s ection 6).  
4.4. Communication and procedures  
Safety issue - A number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk 
of trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station.   
4.4.1.  The signaller had two options for recover ing the train back to the Wellington Station platform.  
The first was to lea ve the train where it was until a clear route could be set for it  to move the full  
distance back to  the platform.  The second  option was to verbally authorise the train to move up 
to Signal 39 at 'All Red -  Stop' wher e it would be held until the  remaining  route to the platform 
could be set , which was the  intention  in this case . 
4.4.2.  The benefit  of mov ing the train to Signal 39 was that t he signaller would know exactly where the 
train was, rather than somewhere with in the 368 -metre section of track between Signal 39 and 
Signal 37 (see Figure 5) .  However, in this  situation there may have been some benefit in the 
signaller and the driver conversing to establish the exact location of the train before any 
movement was authorised.  Had they done so, they may  have realised that the train was not 
clear of  Signal 39, and the situation would have been resolved without any conflict with other 
trains.   The communication they did have and the actions they took were based on the false 
infor mation provided by the mimic panel.  
4.4.3.  The potential for train drivers to fail to stop at 'All Red - Stop' signals is a known and 
foreseeable risk .  This risk would have been mitigated had the train remained  where it was until 
there was a clear (green) route back to the s tation platform.  
4.4.4.  A balance needs to be achieved between mitigating th e risk of signalling trains up to a red 
signal and achieving efficiencies for the metropolitan train system, particular ly during peak 
hours.  
4.4.5.  Ideally, a track -signalling system should be able to provide a sufficient safety separation  
between train movements so that a train inadvertently passing a signal at red would be less 
likely to be involved in a collision with another train .  In this case the train was retu rning to the 
platform through an area  where limited available space made for a congested track layout.  This 
meant there w ere fewer opportunities to create the ideal  safety separation  between train 
movements.  
4.4.6.  The Commission raised this issue in  its report into another potential collision in the vicinity of 
Wellington Railway Station (Inquiry RO -2016 -101), noting  that , "There is a heightened risk of 
trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited available space 
makes the track l ayout congested.  The existing layout means there are fewer safety overlaps 
designed into this area and fewer fail -safe back -up systems in place in the event of a driver  
failing to stop at a red light".  
4.4.7.  The previous report had also noted  that any increase in commuter train services into and out of 
Wellington through this tight track layout increases the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in 
turn increases the underlying risk of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights.  
4.4.8.  Although the circumstances of  the previous incident and this one are different, the arising 
safety issue is  the same.  The Commission has recognised the need to take long - and short -
term approach es to mitigating any risks . 
4.4.9.  In its previous report the Commission  recognised that deconges ting and modernis ing the track 
and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will require significant resources, and that this is 
unlikely to occur in the near future.

 Final Report RO -2017- 103 4.4.10.  Further, n oting that there will likely be future increases in rail patronage and that the system is 
already congested, there are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to 
further reduce the risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellingto n Station, such as:  
• providing better recognition of signals  
• standard procedures for signalling trains through the area  
• better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.  
4.4.11.  The Commission has previously recommended that:  
• KiwiRail  liaise with Greater Wellington Regional Council to develop a long -term strategy for 
the metropolitan rail system, with a view to identifying and addressing the current safety 
issues with the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station ar ea [033/17]  
• KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to 
further reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer -term 
solution can be made. [034/17]  
4.4.12.  Refer to section 7 of this report (R ecommendations) for the full text and KiwiRail's  responses to 
the recommendations .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The driver stopping the train and the decision to return to the platform were  in accordance with 
the principles of safe train operations.  
5.2. Where the train stopped  was not accurately represented to the signaller on the mimic screen . 
The mimic screen gave the signaller a false indication that the train was n orth of Signal 39.  
5.3. The eight -metre  separation between Signal 39 and the insulated joint had not been identified  
as a potential issue when the lines in the area were modified and upgraded in 2010 . 
5.4. There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
because limited available space makes the track layout congested.  The existing layout means 
there are fewer safety overlaps designed into this area and fewer fail -safe back -up systems in 
place in the event of a train passing a red light .

 Final Report RO -2017- 103 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address  other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
• In response to the incident , Transdev Wellington  Limited (the operator) : 
o partnered the driv er with a tutor and provided remedial training  
o briefed all staff on the importance of safety -critical communication  
o implemented random radio audits to assess the practi ce of safety -critical 
communication between train drivers and KiwiRail signallers and controllers  
o held a meeting with KiwiRail and the NZ Transport Agency  to discuss the 
management of risk in the Wellington Railway Station limits . 
• In response to the incident , KiwiRail:  
o completed a  review of similar track layouts in the Wellington metro area 
o implemented additional track circuit sequencing for Signal 38 and Signal 39 ( see 
diagram below) : 
• for 38 signal -  track circuit 38T will not show unoccupied until 97T is 
unoccupied for Up trains  
• for 39 Signal  - track circuit 98T will not show unoccupied until 37BT is 
unoccupied for Up trains  
o relocated the axle counter head for Signal 205 at Petone so that it is aligned with 
the signal .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or  to the wider transport 
sector.  In this case, no new recom mendations have been issued . 
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that any recommendations are implemented 
without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
Previous recommendations to KiwiRail  
7.3. There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station 
because limited available space makes the track layout congested.  The existing layout means 
there are fewer safety overlaps designed into this area and fewer fail -safe back -up systems in 
place in the event of a driver failing to stop at a red light.  
Any increases in commuter train services into and out of Wellington through this tight track 
layout will increase the pre ssure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increase the underlying 
risk of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights.  
Decongest ing and modernis ing the track and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will 
require significant resources, which is u nlikely to occur in the near future.  However, there will 
likely be future increases in rail patronage and the system is already congested.  
On 15 December 2017 the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail 
liaise with Greater Wellington R egional Council to develop a long -term strategy for the 
metropolitan rail system, with a view to identifying and addressing the current safety issues with 
the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station area.  [033/17]  
7.4. On 23 January 2018 the Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied:  
KiwiRail accepts the recommendation as presented and will be engaging with the 
Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) for developing a long -term strategy for 
improving the safety of the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington 
Station area.  
7.5. On 6 July 2018 KiwiRail supplied the Commission with the following update:  
KiwiRail and GWRC [Greater Wellington Regional Council] have worked to put a joint 
funding case to MoT [Ministry of Transport] for imp rovements to the track and 
signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station area which includes the 
implementation of ETCS  [European train control system] .  Work is currently underway 
to produce a development plan for the entire Wellington Metro system -  this will 
include short, medium and longer term strategies for the Wellington throat area . 
7.6. There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk 
of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station, such as: 
• providing better recognition of signals  
• standard procedures for signalling trains through the area  
• better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.  
This incident has shown that more work is required of KiwiRail to furthe r reduce the likelihood 
of trains colliding within the Wellington Station area.  
On 15 December 2017 the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail 
conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce  
the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer -term solution can be made.  
[034/17]

 Final Report RO -2017- 103 7.7. On 23 January 2018 the Chief Executive of KiwiRail replied, in part:  
KiwiRail, GWRC and Transdev Wellington already co -operate closely on operatin g and 
strategic matters.  This is required by the Wellington Network Agreement and is 
supported by an MOU between the three organisations.  
KiwiRail are in agreement to conduct a review of current arrangements in order to try 
to identify opportunit ies for a ttempting to reduce the risk to train operations in the 
Wellington station area.  
7.8. On 6 July 2018 KiwiRail supplied the Commission with the following update:  
A route risk review of the Wellington ' throat ' area is currently nearing completion.  
New recommendations  
7.9. No new recommendations have been made as a result of th is inquiry . 
  
 
Final Report RO -2017- 103

 8. Key l esson  
8.1. Trains should not be unnecessarily authorised to proceed up to red signals in congested areas, 
because the reduced safety margins in these areas increase the risk of a collision if a signal is 
passed at danger .
