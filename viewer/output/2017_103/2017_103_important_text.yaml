  \ in a potential collision with another passenger train in the approaches to \n\
  Wellington Station.  The area is subject to a permanent speed restriction of 20\
  \ kilometres per \nhour .  Nevertheless, a potential collision between two loaded\
  \ passenger trains is a serious \nissue.  \n4.1.2.  This analysis discusses what\
  \ happened and then the following safety issue s that have been \nidentified in\
  \  a previous report  published by the Commission11: \n\u2022 there is a heightened\
  \ risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station \nbecause\
  \ limited space makes the track layout congested  \n\u2022 a number of reasonable\
  \ measures had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains \ncolliding in\
  \ the ap proa ches to Wellington Station .  When the line was upgraded to \nbidirectional12,\
  \ the eight -metre separation between the insulated joint and the signal was \n\
  not identified as a potential issue.  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  The incident\
  \ sequence began when the driver elected to stop the  train owing to a perception\
  \ \nthat the brakes on the last carriage were 'dragging' (partially applied).  A\
  \ s ubsequent \nmaintenance examination revealed no fault with the actual brake\
  \ system, and an update of the \ntrain m onitoring s ystem BIOS13 resolved the high-brake\
  \ -pressure reading.  \n4.2.2.  It is about as likely as  not that the apparent\
  \ dragging the driver felt was caused by resistance  as \nthe rear of the train\
  \ ran through set s of points.  Train brakes are  a safety -critical system and\
  \ the \ndriver was right to check them on departure from the platform . \n4.2.3.\
  \  The problem arose because  the train stopped with its  rear bogie positioned\
  \ within the eight -\nmetre length  of track between th e insulated joint and Signal\
  \ 39 .  The location was unfortunate.  \nHaving passed over the insulated joint,\
  \ the track signalling system displayed to the signaller on \nthe mimic panel that\
  \ the rear of the train had passed Signal 39, when in fact it had not.  The \nmimic\
  \ screen  showed  the signaller that the train had stopped somewhere within the\
  \ 368 -metre \nsection of track between Signal 39 and the next signal  (see Figure\
  \ 5).  The signaller had no \nreason to doubt the accuracy of the information being\
  \ presented on  the mimic screen.\n                                            \

  \ collision, Wellington Railway Station, 28 \nMay 2016.  \n12 A track on which trains\

  \  \n4.2.4.  After  chang ing driving ends , the driver  did not notice that Signal\
  \ 39 was just behind the driving \ncab.  The driver would have walked past the signal\
  \ while walking  through  the train, stopping to \nconvers e with the train manager\
  \ and answer some  passengers' questions.   In response to the \nsignaller's instruction\
  \ to \" come around \" to Signal 39, the driver moved the  train s outhward in a\
  \ \npotential conflicting movement with another passen ger train heading into Wellington\
  \  Railway \nStation .  \n4.2.5.  Fortunately the signaller saw on the  mimic screen\
  \ that the train had entered the next track \nsecti on, and radioed the driver \
  \ to stop.  \n4.3. Signalling system  \nSafety issue - There is a heightened risk\
  \ of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington \nStation because limited\
  \ space makes the track layout congested .  When the line was u pgraded \nto bidirecti\
  \ onal14, the eight -metre  separation between  the insulat ed joint and the signal\
  \ was not \nidentified as a potential issue.  \n4.3.1.  KiwiRail signallers, drivers\
  \ and signals engineers spoken to all confirmed their understanding \nthat a train\
  \ being 'clear of a signal' meant that the whole train had moved pas t the physical\
  \ \nsignal post and that the signal would then be visible to a driver operating\
  \ from the other end of \nthe train.  \n4.3.2.  When Signal 39 was installed , the\
  \ track was dedicated to  train s travelling inbound to \nWellin gton.   As part\
  \ of a significant project to increase capacity into and out of Wellington \nStation\
  \ in 2010, a third main line was added and the now middle main track was made \n\
  bidirectional.  This allowed trains to be routed along the middle main track either\
  \ outbound \nfrom or inbound to Wellington depending on demand.  The insulated joint\
  \ associated with Signal \n39 was modified and a TrainStop15 installed  as part\
  \ of the project . \n4.3.3.  Signal 39 is protected by a Train Stop for inbound\
  \ Wellington trains .  The device was installed \nnext to the signal and was designed\
  \ to activate the brakes of an inbound train  automatically  if it \npasse d the\
  \ signal at red .  It is a means of protecting the busy and congested approaches\
  \ to \nWellington Station from  trains that d o not stop at red signals .  The device\
  \ works via  a lever that \nis raise d when the signal is at red and the last set\
  \ of train wheels has passed over the insulated \njoint associated with the signal\
  \ .  This raised lever catches on a trip lever device mounted on the \nside of the\
  \ tr ain and activates the train brake s (see Figure 6).  \n                   \

  \ to run in both directions.  \n15 A device that ensures compliance w ith a signal\
  \ displaying a stop aspect by automatically applying the train \nbrakes should the\

  \  \n  \n4.3.4.  The insulated joint was  placed eight metres behind the TrainStop\
  \ device (and the signal) so that \nany part  of the train that was overhanging\
  \ the last set of wheels would not catch on the raised  \nTrainStop lever and damage\
  \ the device  (see Figure 7).    \n \nFigure 7 \nSignal and Train Stop position\

  \ of Wellington Railway Station  (Inquiry \nRO-2016 -101)16, the Commission noted\
  \ the safety issue of the heightened risk of trains \ncolliding within the approaches\
  \ to Wellington S tation because limited space makes the track \nlayout congested.\
  \  \n                                                        \n16 Rail inquiry RO\
  \ -2016- 101, signal passed at danger leading to near collision, Wellington Railway\
  \ Station,  \n28 May 2016.  \n\n \nFinal Report RO -2017- 103 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\
  \ 4.3.6.  In response to a recommendation from the Commission , KiwiRail agreed\
  \ to develop a long -term \nstrategy for improving the safety of the track and infrastructure\
  \ in the Wellington Station area.  \n4.3.7.  In response to this incident, KiwiRail\
  \ has modified  the signalling system at Signal 39 and similar \nsignals in the\
  \ Wellington area  (see s ection 6).  \n4.4. Communication and procedures  \nSafety\
  \ issue - A number of reasonable measures had not been taken to further reduce the\
  \ risk \nof trains colliding in the approaches to Wellington Station.   \n4.4.1.\
  \  The signaller had two options for recover ing the train back to the Wellington\
  \ Station platform.  \nThe first was to lea ve the train where it was until a clear\
  \ route could be set for it  to move the full  \ndistance back to  the platform.\
  \  The second  option was to verbally authorise the train to move up \nto Signal\
  \ 39 at 'All Red -  Stop' wher e it would be held until the  remaining  route to\
  \ the platform \ncould be set , which was the  intention  in this case . \n4.4.2.\
  \  The benefit  of mov ing the train to Signal 39 was that t he signaller would\
  \ know exactly where the \ntrain was, rather than somewhere with in the 368 -metre\
  \ section of track between Signal 39 and \nSignal 37 (see Figure 5) .  However,\
  \ in this  situation there may have been some benefit in the \nsignaller and the\
  \ driver conversing to establish the exact location of the train before any \nmovement\
  \ was authorised.  Had they done so, they may  have realised that the train was\
  \ not \nclear of  Signal 39, and the situation would have been resolved without\
  \ any conflict with other \ntrains.   The communication they did have and the actions\
  \ they took were based on the false \ninfor mation provided by the mimic panel.\
  \  \n4.4.3.  The potential for train drivers to fail to stop at 'All Red - Stop'\
  \ signals is a known and \nforeseeable risk .  This risk would have been mitigated\
  \ had the train remained  where it was until \nthere was a clear (green) route back\
  \ to the s tation platform.  \n4.4.4.  A balance needs to be achieved between mitigating\
  \ th e risk of signalling trains up to a red \nsignal and achieving efficiencies\
  \ for the metropolitan train system, particular ly during peak \nhours.  \n4.4.5.\
  \  Ideally, a track -signalling system should be able to provide a sufficient safety\
  \ separation  \nbetween train movements so that a train inadvertently passing a\
  \ signal at red would be less \nlikely to be involved in a collision with another\
  \ train .  In this case the train was retu rning to the \nplatform through an area\
  \  where limited available space made for a congested track layout.  This \nmeant\
  \ there w ere fewer opportunities to create the ideal  safety separation  between\
  \ train \nmovements.  \n4.4.6.  The Commission raised this issue in  its report\
  \ into another potential collision in the vicinity of \nWellington Railway Station\
  \ (Inquiry RO -2016 -101), noting  that , \"There is a heightened risk of \ntrains\
  \ colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited available\
  \ space \nmakes the track l ayout congested.  The existing layout means there are\
  \ fewer safety overlaps \ndesigned into this area and fewer fail -safe back -up\
  \ systems in place in the event of a driver  \nfailing to stop at a red light\"\
  .  \n4.4.7.  The previous report had also noted  that any increase in commuter train\
  \ services into and out of \nWellington through this tight track layout increases\
  \ the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in \nturn increases the underlying risk\
  \ of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights.  \n4.4.8.  Although the circumstances\
  \ of  the previous incident and this one are different, the arising \nsafety issue\
  \ is  the same.  The Commission has recognised the need to take long - and short\
  \ -\nterm approach es to mitigating any risks . \n4.4.9.  In its previous report\
  \ the Commission  recognised that deconges ting and modernis ing the track \nand\
  \ signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will require significant resources,\
  \ and that this is \nunlikely to occur in the near future.   \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n\
  \ Final Report RO -2017- 103 4.4.10.  Further, n oting that there will likely be\
  \ future increases in rail patronage and that the system is \nalready congested,\
  \ there are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to \nfurther\
  \ reduce the risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellingto n Station,\
  \ such as:  \n\u2022 providing better recognition of signals  \n\u2022 standard\
  \ procedures for signalling trains through the area  \n\u2022 better communication\
  \ between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.  \n4.4.11.  The Commission\
  \ has previously recommended that:  \n\u2022 KiwiRail  liaise with Greater Wellington\
  \ Regional Council to develop a long -term strategy for \nthe metropolitan rail\
  \ system, with a view to identifying and addressing the current safety \nissues\
  \ with the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station ar ea [033/17]\
  \  \n\u2022 KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities\
  \ it can to \nfurther reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more\
  \ suitable longer -term \nsolution can be made. [034/17]  \n4.4.12.  Refer to section\
  \ 7 of this report (R ecommendations) for the full text and KiwiRail's  responses\
