  \ data from the train's event recorder showed that the train was travelling \nbelow\
  \ the authorised line speed at the time of the derailment .  There is nothing to\
  \ suggest \nthat the way the train was being driven contributed to the accident.\
  \  \n4.1.2.  It is almost certain that the trailer passenger coach had been put\
  \ back into service on 8 March \n2013 without the bolts that connected the spring\
  \ park brake assembly to their hangers being \neither lock -wired or having their\
  \ split pins fitted.  \n4.1.3.  Without anythin g to secure the bolts in place,\
  \ they worked loose over the following 10 weeks \nin service  and eventually dropp\
  \ ed out.  Without being supported by  the hangers , the entire \nweight of the\
  \ assembly was taken on its welded connection to the bogie frame .  The main  \n\
  purpose of the connection between the spring park brake assembly and the hangers\
  \ was to \nabsorb the rotational force applied by the brake  pads to the brake disc\
  \ when  the brakes were \napplied.  Without the hanger pins in place to react against\
  \ the braking fo rces, the application \nof the brake would have exerted higher\
  \ -than -normal forces on the welded connection, which \nwas already supporting\
  \ the entire weight of the spring park brake assembly.  \n4.1.4.  Eventually the\
  \ welded connection failed , allow ing the spring park  brake assembly to fall to\
  \ the \ntrack, where it jammed on the underslung air rese rvoirs  and air compressor\
  \ .  The forces \ninvolved pushed the air compressor up through the coach floor\
  \ and were  sufficient to derail \nthe train.  \n4.1.5.  Passengers on the derailed\
  \ coach reca lled hearing scraping noises before the accident.  \nThese were most\
  \ likely associated with the spring park brake  assembly  being forced \ndown wards\
  \  when the driver made brake applications.  \n4.1.6.  The Commission considered\
  \ the emergency response  to the accident and concluded that , \nunder the circumstances\
  \ , it was appropriate.  For first responders to a train accident there will \n\
  inevitably be a delicate balance between the need to provide assistance immediately\
  \  and the \nrisks associated with a derai led train in contact with  a high-voltage\
  \ overhead traction  contact \nwire.   \n4.1.7.  The high -voltage overhead traction\
  \ contact wire  was not damaged in the derailment, and the \ndriver took the initiative\
  \ to lower the pantographs that connected the train to the overhe ad \nline.  As\
  \ a precaution the evacuation was delayed until it was confirmed that the overhead\
  \ \ntraction line had been isolated  and earthed .  Given the minor nature of the\
  \ injuries it was \nreasonable  to hold the passengers on board until there was\
  \ absolutely certain ty of no risk to \npassengers and first -response rescue teams.\
  \  \n4.1.8.  The safety issue s arising from this accident relates  to the standard\
  \ of maintenance for a  \nsafety -critical braking system , in particular  the procedures\
  \ for ensuring that maintenance was \nconducted in accordance with best engineering\
  \ practice  and that there were  independent final \ncheck s of critical systems\
  \ bef ore electric multiple units  were  released back into service.  \n4.2. Maintenance\
  \ procedures  \n4.2.1.  The Wellington metro maintenance depot had various procedures\
  \ for each type of check.  \nHowever, there were no documented task instructions\
  \ setting out how safety -critical task s \nwere  to be performed on the Ganz Mavag\
  \ fleet , and no means of record ing progress  against \nthe individual steps in\
  \ the task .  Instea d, for the previous  30 years depot management had \nrelied\
  \ on the institutional knowledge and experience of its staff to conduct proper \n\
  maintenance and  ensure that trains  were  fit for purpose  when returned to service\
  \ .   \n4.2.2.  The brakin g system on a train is a saf ety-critical system, as\
  \ are its components.  A simple \ncheck by an appropriate person to confirm that\
  \ the split pins had been inserted in the hanger \nbolts would have prevented this\
  \ accident.  \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -104 4.2.3.  However,\
  \ n o systematic assessment had been undertaken to identify safety -critical systems\
  \ \nand their components.  Also, there were no mandatory  check s by people  independent\
  \ of those \ndoing the work  that the  work had been performed in accordance with\
  \ the Code. \n4.2.4.  The Commission has reported on a similar safety issue involving\
  \ the maintenance of the \nAuckland metropolitan train fleet.  Following a series\
  \ of maintenance -related occurrences9, in \n2007 the Commission made a safety recommendation\
  \ to the Director of Land Transport New \nZealand (now the NZ Transport Agenc y)\
  \ aimed at improving the standards of maintenance \nconducted in the Auckland metro\
  \ maintenance depot.  The recommendation was for the \nDirector to ensure that:\
  \  \n\uF0B7 engineering standards consistent with world standard practice are identified\
  \ and adhered \nto \n\uF0B7 manufacturers' inspection, repair and maintenance instructions\
  \ are documented and \nfollowed  \n\uF0B7 safety -critical components are identified\
  \ and documented  \n\uF0B7 work instructions are issued for maintaining safety -critical\
  \ equipment  \n\uF0B7 work on safety -critical components i s signed off by someone\
  \ other than the maintainer  \n\uF0B7 all maintenance work is recorded.  \n4.2.5.\
  \  The previous recommendation to address the Auckland situation is equally applicable\
  \ to the \nsafety issue identified with the Wellington metro maintenance depot \
  \ during this i nquiry .  \nAccordin gly, on 13 August 2013, before this inquiry\
  \ was complete, the Commission made  the \nsame  urgent recommendation to the Chief\
  \ Executive of KiwiRail to address th e same issues \nidentified in its Wellington\
  \ metro maintenance depot .  The Commissio n also made a \nrecommendation to the\
  \ Chief Executive of the N Z Transport Agency to monitor KiwiRail's \nimplementation\
  \ of the Commission's recommendation ( refer to the recommendation s section \n\
  of this report for the full recommendations and responses).  \n4.2.6.  KiwiRai l\
  \ made  a number of improvements to its Wellington depot maintenance procedures\
  \ as \nthe Commission's inquiry progressed.  Refer to Section 6 ( 'Safety actions\
  \ ') for a full \ndescription of the timing and nature of those improvements.  \n\
