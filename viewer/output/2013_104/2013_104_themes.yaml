- name: Maintenance Procedures and Documentation
  explanation: The lack of documented task instructions for safety-critical tasks, such as those related to the maintenance of the Ganz Mavag fleet, is a significant safety theme. The Wellington metro maintenance depot had no means of recording progress against individual steps in a task, which contributed to the omission of fitting retaining split pins on the bolts securing the spring park brake assembly. This omission led to the brake assembly becoming disconnected and ultimately causing the derailment ("there were no documented task instructions setting out how safety-critical tasks were to be performed on the Ganz Mavag fleet" (4.2.1)). The absence of such documentation and the reliance on institutional knowledge over formal procedures increased the risk of maintenance errors ("depot management had relied on the institutional knowledge and experience of its staff to conduct proper maintenance" (4.2.1)).
- name: Safety-Critical System Identification and Checks
  explanation: The failure to systematically assess and identify safety-critical systems and their components, as well as the lack of mandatory checks by independent personnel, is another safety theme. The braking system is a safety-critical system, and a simple check by an appropriate person could have prevented the accident ("A simple check by an appropriate person to confirm that the split pins had been inserted in the hanger bolts would have prevented this accident" (4.2.2)). The absence of such systematic assessments and checks allowed the omission of the split pins to go unnoticed, leading to the derailment ("no systematic assessment had been undertaken to identify safety-critical systems and their components" (4.2.3)).
- name: Emergency Response and Risk Management
  explanation: The emergency response to the accident and the balance between immediate assistance and the risks associated with a derailed train in contact with a high-voltage overhead traction contact wire is a safety theme. The Commission concluded that the emergency response was appropriate under the circumstances, highlighting the importance of risk management during such events ("For first responders to a train accident there will inevitably be a delicate balance between the need to provide assistance immediately and the risks associated with a derailed train in contact with a high-voltage overhead traction contact wire" (4.1.6)). The driver's initiative to lower the pantographs and the delayed evacuation until the overhead traction line was isolated and earthed demonstrate effective risk management practices ("the driver took the initiative to lower the pantographs that connected the train to the overhead line" (4.1.7)).
- name: Maintenance Standards and Best Engineering Practices
  explanation: Adherence to maintenance standards and best engineering practices is a critical safety theme. The accident revealed issues with the standard of maintenance for a safety-critical braking system and the need for procedures to ensure maintenance is conducted according to best engineering practices ("The safety issues arising from this accident relates to the standard of maintenance for a safety-critical braking system" (4.1.8)). The Commission's previous recommendations for the Auckland metro maintenance depot, which included adhering to engineering standards and following manufacturers' instructions, are equally applicable to the Wellington depot, indicating a broader issue with maintenance practices across different locations ("The previous recommendation to address the Auckland situation is equally applicable to the safety issue identified with the Wellington metro maintenance depot" (4.2.5)).
- name: Independent Verification of Maintenance Work
  explanation: The absence of independent verification of maintenance work on safety-critical systems is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. There was no requirement for work on such systems to be checked and signed off by people not directly involved in the work, which could have detected or prevented the omission of the split pins ("no requirement for work on safety-critical systems, and their components, to be checked and signed off by people not directly involved in the work" (5.4)). The need for independent checks is underscored by the fact that such a process would likely have caught the error before the coach was released to service, preventing the derailment ("Had there been it is highly likely that the omission would have been avoided, or at least detected and rectified, before the coach was released to service" (5.4)).
- name: Institutional Knowledge vs. Formal Training
  explanation: The reliance on institutional knowledge instead of formal training and documented procedures is a safety theme that played a role in the accident. The maintenance depot's dependence on the experience of its staff without formalized procedures increased the risk of critical maintenance steps being overlooked ("depot management had relied on the institutional knowledge and experience of its staff to conduct proper maintenance" (4.2.1)). This reliance on institutional knowledge is problematic because it does not provide a consistent and reliable method for ensuring that all safety-critical tasks are completed correctly, as evidenced by the omission that led to the derailment.
