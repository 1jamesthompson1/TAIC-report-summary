  \ pilot reported a sudden, large decrease in engine power while the helicopter was\
  \ in the \ncruise.  His subsequent inability to restore sufficient power to recover\
  \ to the shore forced him \nto ditch  the helicopter .  The pilot's recollection\
  \ of the engine parameters at the time of the \nditching was the only information\
  \ that might have been useful for diagnosing the problem .  \nUnfortunately, his\
  \ recollection of the engine performance w as vague and he did not recall \nparameters\
  \ such as the  N1, which would have indicated how much power the engine was \ndeveloping.\
  \  \n4.1.2  The one recollection the pilot did have was an observed decrease in\
  \ the N2.  There a re 3 \nbroad factors that could cause such a re duction:  pilot\
  \ action, a technical defect  and an \nenvironmental (weather) factor.  The weather\
  \ was acceptable for the nature of the flight, with \nmild temperatures and no precipitation,\
  \ and is not considered further.  The other potential \nfactors are examined  further\
  \ , and some survival issues  are also examined.  \n4.2 Possible causes for the\
  \ power loss   \nPilot action  \n4.2.1  The pilot said that he was in the cruise\
  \ when he heard a noise and saw the N2 decrease.  The \nnoise  was likely the change\
  \ in engine note with the N2 reduction, rather than a sound of \nmechanical failure\
  \  for which no evidence was found .  Also, the engine continued to run.  A \ncompressor\
  \ stall was unlikely to occur in the cruise when the power demand was steady, and\
  \ \nthe reported symptoms were unlike those of a compressor stall.  \n4.2.2  In\
  \ any event, he took the appropriate immediate action of putting the helicopter\
  \ into an \nautorotative descent and he also e nsured that the throttle was wide\
  \ open .  He said the N2 \nsettled at about  60-70%, which w ould have been well\
  \ outside the beep switch range.  \n4.2.3  The autorotative descent probably took\
  \ less than 35  seconds.  In this time the pilot would \nhave assessed the situation\
  \ before turning more than 90 degrees to be more into wind for the \npoten tial\
  \ water landing .  The  concentration required to perform this manoeuvre  might\
  \ explain \nwhy he was unable to  recall other engine indications  during the descent\
  \ . \n4.2.4  The pilot's immediate reaction of lowering the collective lever conserved\
  \ the NR, which was \ncritical for his continued control of the helicopter,  and\
  \ w as also the appropriate action had the \nN2 decrease been caused by a catastrophic\
  \ engine failure .  In spite of his describing the \nlanding as firm, t he lack\
  \ of significant damage to the fuselage belly  suggested that he made a \nwell executed\
  \ ditching .  The harder impact that followed could have been the result of his\
  \ not \nreduc ing the NR sufficiently  before he tilted the rotor blades towards\
  \ the water . \n4.2.5  The pilot had no unprompted recollection that the helicopter\
  \ yaw ed, which was surprising \ngiven the  size and abruptness of the power reduction\
  \ .  Helicopter pilots are generally very \naware of y aw and the direction of yaw\
  \ , as it can distinguish engine and tail rotor  malfunction s \nthat usually require\
  \ an immediat e reaction.   The absence of continued yaw and his retaining \nfull\
  \ directional control until the water entry indicated that the aircraft had not\
  \ suffered  a tail \nrotor problem.  In any event, a tail rotor malfunction would\
  \ not have decreased the N2.  \n4.2.6  The pilot  said that the ENG OUT and ROTOR\
  \ LOW RPM warning lights did not illuminate, nor \nwere there any aural warning\
  \ s.  The CAUTION circuit breaker, which protects these 2 systems, \nwas found open\
  \ after the accident, which could expla in that.  However, it is also common to\
  \ \nfind that circuit breakers have opened after an aircraft has sustained a substantial\
  \ impact, \nand the main rotor striking  the sea might  have been of sufficient\
  \ force  to open circuit \nbreakers .  Although the pilot did not recall the N1,\
  \ he did say t hat the engine had kept \noperating .  If the N1 had remained above\
  \ 55% the ENG OUT warning  would not have been \ntriggered .  Similarly, the pilot\
  \  had likely kept the N R within the autorotation range , which would \nhave avoided\
  \ a  ROTOR LOW RPM warning . \n  \nReport 11 -001 \n<< Page 15 >>\n Finding  \n\
  There was no evidence that any act or omission of the pilot contributed to the loss\
  \ of \nengine performance.  \n \n \nTechnical  causes  \n4.2.7  The Rolls -Royce\
  \ Technical Review in 2011 listed the general  causes for maintenance -related \n\
  engine events .  While that list did not include all possible causes , most of th\
  \ ose given were \neliminated as potential cause s of this event.   \n4.2.8  The\
  \ fuel control unit  and power turbine governor  work together to deliver the fuel\
  \ flow required \nto meet the power demand.  The N2 speed is a function of the N1\
  \ speed, which is a direct \nresult of the amount of fuel being sent to the combustor.\
  \ The reported large reduction in N2 \ncould have resulted from an issue with the\
  \ power turbine governor or the fuel control unit \nand/or their respective external\
  \ lines.  \n4.2.9  The pneumatic  lines could not be pressure checked because of\
  \ impact damage.  The B -nuts in \nthe line s were only checked to be finger tight,\
  \ rather than having their break -away torque \nmeasured.  Although some evidence\
  \ of torque paint was seen, it could not b e confirmed \nwhether  it had been  applied\
  \ at the time that the engine , fuel control unit  or power turbine \ngovernor had\
  \ last been service d.  Even if the nuts had been tightened to the correct torque,\
  \ \nthe flared end of a line could have been cracked.  \n4.2.10  No signif icant\
  \ defect was found during the inspections of the fuel control unit  and the power\
  \ \nturbine governor , the key fuel system components.  Neither component could\
  \ be functionally \ntested, so there was a remote possibility that one or other\
  \ had a transient defe ct.  However, it \nwould have been  very unlikely for a transient\
  \ defect to cause the prolonged N2 reduction.  \n4.2.11  When the engine was disassembled,\
  \ no evidence was found of a pre -existing mechanical \ndefect or of foreign object\
  \ damage in the compressor or turbine sections.  Bearings showed \nevidence of normal\
  \ oil supply.  The accessory gearbox was disintegrating by the time the \nengine\
  \ was disassembled due to the effects of salt -water corrosion  on the gearbox case\
  \ .  As a \nresult, although all the gears and bearings appeared to be present,\
  \ comment on their pre -\nimpact integrity was limited to noting that the output\
  \ shaft to the main rotor had been turning \nat impact . \n4.2.12  The pilot said\
  \ that the helicopter fuel tank had been  filled 9 days before the accident at \
  \ \nWhangarei Aerodrome.  There had been  no incidents reported around that time\
  \ to suggest \nthat there might have been a problem with the aerodrome supply. \
  \ He had topped up the fuel \ntank before the flight from his fuel trailer, a nd\
  \ a sample of that fuel was later tested and found \nto be of acceptable quality.\
  \  Having a near -full tank  when the helicopter was parked  for a week \nwould\
  \ have minimised the condensation of water .  The pilot said that he had performed\
  \ the \nrequired water check before the flight.  With ful l tanks, the flight duration\
  \ was well within the \nfuel endurance.  The pilot's skin was burned by contact\
  \ with floating fuel , and w hen the \nwreckage was recovered considerable fuel\
  \ drained from the fuselage.   All of t his evidence \nconfirmed that the event\
  \ had not been a case of fuel exhaustion (running out of fuel).  \n4.2.13  Clean\
  \ f uel was found in the nozzle  when it was removed from the combustion liner ,\
  \ and the \nscreen was clean and not malformed.  The helicopter engine function\
  \ ed normally until the \nreduction in N 2, but the engine continued to run until\
  \ the ditch ing.  Therefore  fuel continued to \nreach the engine  and this was\
  \ not a case of fuel starvation (interruption of supply).  \n4.2.14  The logbook\
  \ discrepancies regarding the accessories gearbox and compressor section part \n\
  numbers were not resolved, but were very unlikely to be related to the occurrence.\
  \  However, \nthe discrepancies  and some inconsistencies in details recorded in\
  \ the logbo oks and \nspreadsheets indicate d that some past maintenance control\
  \ procedures had not met the \nstandards required by Civil Aviation Rules. \n\n\
  << Page 16 >>\n  | Report 11 -001 Finding  \nNo technical reason was found for the\
  \  reported  engine speed decrease.  \n \n \n4.3 Survival factors  \n4.3.1  The\
  \ flight was made without the pilot having arranged flight -following.  Part of\
  \ the flight  was \nconducted well outside autorotation range of the shore when\
  \ the helicopter was not equipped \nwith an emergency flotation system and the pilot\
  \ was not wearing a l ife jacket .  This was a \nrelatively high -risk scenario.\
  \  \n4.3.2  The pilot  had told a friend that he would be making the flight, but\
  \ there was no legal \nrequirement  for him  to submit a flight plan or to arrange\
  \ flight -following .  Therefore it was not \ncertain whether  anyone would have\
  \ reported him to be missing if the accident had not been \nwitnessed .  The pilot\
  \ did not make an emergency radio call  because he had too little time and \nspare\
  \ capacity to do that while controlling the helico pter during the de scent to the\
  \ sea . \n4.3.3  Although it was summer and the water temperature was not cold,\
  \ his survival very much \ndepended on  the fortuitous sighting of the accident\
  \ by people on shore a nd by the Orion \naeroplane  being  nearby .  The pilot was\
  \ not wearing a life jacket  and, contrary to the Civil \nAviation Rule applicable\
  \ to the offshore flight , none was on board .  Deciding whether to swim \nfor what\
  \ appear s to be  a nearby shore can be a difficult choice for someone in the pilot's\
  \ \nposition , but in this case the helicopter had sunk so ther e was nothing to\
  \ cling to other than \ndebris.  He would not have known whether his accident had\
  \ been witnessed and the \nemergency locator transmitter  was of no help when it\
  \ was on the sea bed .  As a rule, a rescue \nwill be more assured if the survivor\
  \  actuall y wear s a life jacket , especially if it is fitted with a \npersonal\
  \ locator beacon and a flare.   Another point to consider is that any oil or fuel\
  \ slick and \nfloating debris will be more easily spotted from the air.  If a survivor\
  \  remain s in the vicinity they \nwill have more chance of being spotted.  \n4.3.4\
  \  Even if the helicopter emergency location transmitter had been activated immediately\
  \ after \nthe autorotation  had been  commenced , there w as too little time before\
  \ the landing for the \nsignal to be detected.  Had the helicopter remained afloat\
  \ and upright, it was highly probable \nthat the signal would have been detected\
  \ .  However, emergency flotation equipment was \nincompatible with th is helicopter's\
  \ usual agricultural role.  \n4.3.5  Nonetheless , if a forced landing appear s\
  \ likely, pilots should do as this one did and activate \nthe emergency locator\
  \ transmitter as soon as possible and , if time and circumstances permit,  \nmake\
  \ an emergency radio call.  Both distress alerts can be easily cancelled if the\
  \ situation is \nresolved  without need ing further  help. \n4.3.6  The pilot experienced\
  \ some disorientation before escaping from the inverted and submerged \nhelicopter\
  \ , which might have been lessened had he  undertaken a course in h elicopter \n\
  underwater escape training .  Although not a legal requirement, the potential benefit\
  \ of such \ntraining - even for pilots of single -engine aeroplanes who frequently\
  \ operate over water - is \napparent.  \n  \n  \nReport 11 -001 \n<< Page 17 >>\n\
  \ Findings  \nThe pilot operated over water without having a life jacket  on board,\
  \ contrary to Civil \nAviation Rules.  Not wearing a life jacket  reduced his chances\
  \ of survival.  \n \nThe pilot's rescue was due to the fortuitous presence of witnesses\
  \ on shore.  Had he \narranged flight -following and made a timely emergency radio\
  \ call,  his rescue might have \nbeen more assured even without  witnesses.  \n\
  \ \n \n4.4 Summary  \n4.4.1  The cause of the reported engine N2 reduction was not\
  \ determined.  \n4.4.2  The fact that this and other accidents and incidents in\
  \ New Zealand and overseas have \nresulted from apparent techn ical failures, of\
  \ which some remain unresolved , highlights the \nneed for robust systems to be\
  \ in place to enhance the survivability of such events.  \n4.4.3  The pilot did\
  \ not follow some required and recommended steps that would have  increased his\
  \ \nchances of surviva l in the event of an accident when operating over water.\
  \  His rescue was \ngreatly assisted by the accident being witnessed and by a favourable\
  \ on -shore wind.  \n  \n\n<< Page 18 >>"
