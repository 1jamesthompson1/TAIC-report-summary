- name: Human Factors - Fatigue and Alertness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of the pilot's physical or mental state, fatigue, or alertness as contributing factors in the report. The pilot's actions during the emergency were appropriate and there was no evidence of fatigue-related errors (4.2.1-4.2.6).
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The pilot maintained situational awareness by taking immediate action upon hearing a noise and observing the N2 decrease, and by executing an autorotative descent and ditching maneuver (4.2.1, 4.2.4).
- name: Distracted Operation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication in the report that the pilot was distracted or that distracted operation played a role in the accident (4.1.1-4.2.6).
- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report explicitly states that there was no evidence that any act or omission of the pilot contributed to the loss of engine performance (5.1).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report mentions discrepancies and inconsistencies in maintenance records, indicating that some past maintenance control procedures did not meet the standards required by Civil Aviation Rules (4.2.14). This suggests organizational influences and safety culture may have played a role.
- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report does not indicate any issues with communication or crew resource management as factors in the accident. The pilot was operating the helicopter alone, so crew resource management is not applicable (4.1.1-4.2.6).
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot's training for emergency procedures is not directly mentioned as a contributing factor, but the report suggests that helicopter underwater escape training might have lessened disorientation during the escape (4.3.6).
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The lack of flight-following and the absence of a life jacket on board indicate gaps in emergency response planning (4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3).
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The report discusses the possibility of maintenance-related issues, such as the condition of the pneumatic lines and the fuel control unit, although no definitive technical reason for the engine speed decrease was found (4.2.7-4.2.13).
- name: Fire Detection and Suppression Systems
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There was no fire reported in the incident, so fire detection and suppression systems are not relevant to this accident (4.1.1-4.2.14).
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot operated over water without a life jacket on board, which is contrary to Civil Aviation Rules, indicating a lack of regulatory compliance (5.3).
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no information in the report suggesting that the design and specifications of the helicopter or its equipment contributed to the accident (4.1.1-4.2.14).
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report does not provide information on risk assessment and management practices that could have contributed to the accident (4.1.1-4.2.14).
- name: Weather Information Dissemination and Interpretation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Weather was not a factor in the accident, as the weather was acceptable for the nature of the flight (4.1.2).
- name: Structural Integrity and Material Fatigue
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of structural integrity or material fatigue issues contributing to the accident. The helicopter was able to ditch successfully without significant fuselage damage (4.2.4).
- name: Other
  percentage: 50
  explanation: '"Other" encompasses the unidentified cause of the engine N2 reduction, as the report concludes that the cause of the reported engine N2 reduction was not determined (4.4.1). This represents a significant unknown factor in the accident.'
