- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no mention of fatigue or overwork contributing to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident (4.1.1-4.4.3).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The report explicitly states that "there was no evidence that any act or omission of the pilot contributed to the loss of engine performance" (5.1). This suggests that human error and assumptions were not contributing factors in the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not provide any information suggesting that a lack of training or competency on the part of the pilot contributed to the accident. The pilot's actions during the emergency were appropriate (4.2.2-4.2.4).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication in the document that a lack of training or familiarity with the helicopter's equipment contributed to the accident. The pilot's actions suggest he was familiar with the emergency procedures (4.2.2-4.2.4).
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in this accident as there is no mention of crew interactions or teamwork issues affecting the outcome (4.1.1-4.4.3).
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The pilot did not have a life jacket on board, which was contrary to Civil Aviation Rules, and this reduced his chances of survival (5.3). This indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures that could have affected the outcome post-accident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 5
  explanation: There were discrepancies and inconsistencies in maintenance control procedures and logbooks, indicating that some past maintenance control procedures had not met the standards required by Civil Aviation Rules (4.2.14). This suggests issues with the organizational safety culture that could potentially affect safety.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not provide evidence that inadequate risk management and analysis contributed to the accident. The cause of the engine N2 reduction was not determined (4.4.1).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The pilot operated over water without having a life jacket on board, which is against Civil Aviation Rules (5.3). This indicates a lack of regulatory compliance that could have affected survival, not the accident itself.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication that a lack of situational awareness contributed to the accident. The pilot responded appropriately to the emergency situation (4.2.1-4.2.4).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not suggest that emergency response preparedness was a factor in the accident. The pilot's actions during the emergency were appropriate, and the lack of emergency equipment did not contribute to the engine issue (4.2.1-4.2.4).
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Although there were some maintenance discrepancies noted, there was no technical reason found for the reported engine speed decrease, and no significant defect was found during inspections of the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor (5.2, 4.2.10).
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The document does not mention any issues related to the use of automation that could have contributed to the accident (4.1.1-4.4.3).
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Weather was not considered a factor in the accident as the weather was acceptable for the nature of the flight (4.1.2).
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence of communication breakdown contributing to the accident. The pilot did not make an emergency radio call due to the rapid development of the situation, not because of a communication failure (4.3.2).
- name: Other
  percentage: 80
  explanation: The cause of the reported engine N2 reduction was not determined (4.4.1), and no technical reason was found for the engine speed decrease (5.2). Since the document does not provide sufficient information to attribute the cause of the accident to any of the predefined safety themes, the majority of the weighting is assigned to "Other," which encompasses the undetermined technical or mechanical factors that led to the power loss.
