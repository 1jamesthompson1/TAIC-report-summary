- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 20
  explanation: While no technical reason was found for the reported engine speed decrease (5.2), there were discrepancies and inconsistencies in maintenance control procedures that did not meet the standards required by Civil Aviation Rules (4.2.14).
