- name: Engine Performance Monitoring
  explanation: Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme that involves the regular assessment and tracking of engine parameters to ensure the engine is functioning correctly. In this accident, the pilot reported "a sudden, large decrease in engine power" (4.1.1) and was unable to recall critical engine parameters such as the N1, which would have indicated the power the engine was developing (4.1.1). The lack of detailed engine performance data hindered the diagnosis of the problem, emphasizing the importance of effective engine monitoring for safety.
- name: Pilot Training and Emergency Response
  explanation: Pilot training and emergency response preparedness are essential for handling unexpected situations such as power loss. In this incident, the pilot "took the appropriate immediate action of putting the helicopter into an autorotative descent" (4.2.2) and managed to execute a well-executed ditching despite the firm landing (4.2.4). However, the pilot's inability to recall other engine indications (4.2.3) and the absence of a recollection of yaw (4.2.5) suggest that training on situational awareness and emergency procedures is relevant to this accident.
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Procedures
  explanation: Maintenance and inspection procedures are crucial to ensure that aircraft components function correctly and reliably. The investigation found that "no significant defect was found during the inspections of the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor" (4.2.10), but there were discrepancies in maintenance records (4.2.14). These findings highlight the importance of thorough and accurate maintenance and inspection practices as a safety theme related to this accident.
- name: Fuel Management
  explanation: Fuel management encompasses the proper handling, quality control, and monitoring of fuel to prevent issues such as fuel starvation or contamination. In this case, the pilot ensured that the fuel tank was topped up (4.2.12), and tests confirmed the fuel quality was acceptable (4.2.12). Despite the engine power loss, "fuel continued to reach the engine" (4.2.13), indicating that fuel management was not the cause of the accident but remains a critical safety theme.
- name: Survival Equipment and Procedures
  explanation: Survival equipment and procedures are vital for increasing the chances of survival in the event of an accident, especially over water. The pilot operated without a life jacket on board, "contrary to Civil Aviation Rules" (5.3), and his rescue was "due to the fortuitous presence of witnesses on shore" (5.4). This accident underscores the importance of having appropriate survival gear and following procedures to enhance post-accident survivability.
- name: Flight Planning and Monitoring
  explanation: Flight planning and monitoring involve the preparation and tracking of a flight to ensure its safety and to facilitate search and rescue operations if necessary. The pilot did not arrange flight-following (4.3.2), and there was no certainty that anyone would have reported him missing if the accident had not been witnessed (4.3.2). This accident illustrates the safety theme of the need for proper flight planning and monitoring to ensure timely rescue in the event of an emergency.
