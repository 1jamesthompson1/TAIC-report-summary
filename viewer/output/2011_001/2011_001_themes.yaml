- name: Engine Performance Monitoring
  explanation: Engine performance monitoring is a critical safety theme that involves the regular assessment and tracking of engine parameters to ensure the engine is functioning correctly. In this accident, the pilot reported "a sudden, large decrease in engine power" (4.1.1) and was unable to recall critical engine parameters such as the N1, which would have indicated the power the engine was developing (4.1.1). The pilot's vague recollection of engine performance and the lack of diagnostic information highlight the importance of effective engine performance monitoring for identifying and addressing potential issues before they lead to an accident.
- name: Pilot Training and Emergency Response
  explanation: Pilot training and emergency response preparedness are essential for ensuring that pilots can effectively manage unexpected situations. In this case, the pilot "took the appropriate immediate action of putting the helicopter into an autorotative descent" (4.2.2) and managed to execute a well-executed ditching despite the firm landing (4.2.4). However, the pilot's inability to recall other engine indications during the descent (4.2.3) and the lack of helicopter underwater escape training (4.3.6) suggest that additional training could have potentially improved the pilot's response and situational awareness during the emergency.
- name: Aircraft Maintenance and Inspection
  explanation: Aircraft maintenance and inspection are crucial for identifying and rectifying technical defects that could lead to in-flight emergencies. The investigation found no significant defect in the fuel control unit and power turbine governor (4.2.10), and no pre-existing mechanical defect or foreign object damage in the engine (4.2.11). However, the inability to functionally test these components due to impact damage (4.2.10) and discrepancies in maintenance records (4.2.14) indicate that more rigorous maintenance and inspection protocols might be necessary to ensure the reliability of critical aircraft systems.
- name: Fuel Management
  explanation: Fuel management encompasses the proper handling, storage, and quality control of aviation fuel to prevent fuel-related engine issues. In this incident, the pilot had topped up the fuel tank from his fuel trailer, and the fuel was later tested and found to be of acceptable quality (4.2.12). The pilot also performed the required water check before the flight (4.2.12), indicating that fuel management was not a contributing factor to the accident. However, the thorough investigation into the fuel quality and management practices underscores its importance as a safety theme.
- name: Emergency Equipment and Procedures
  explanation: The availability and use of emergency equipment and adherence to emergency procedures are vital for increasing the chances of survival in the event of an accident. The pilot operated over water without a life jacket on board, which was "contrary to Civil Aviation Rules" (5.3), and not wearing a life jacket reduced his chances of survival (5.3). Additionally, the lack of an emergency flotation system and the pilot not wearing a life jacket (4.3.1) highlight the need for proper emergency equipment and procedures, especially when operating over water.
- name: Flight Planning and Communication
  explanation: Flight planning and communication are key to ensuring that flights are conducted safely and that in the event of an emergency, rescue operations can be initiated promptly. The pilot did not arrange flight-following (4.3.2) and did not make an emergency radio call due to the rapid descent to the sea (4.3.2). The pilot's rescue was fortuitous due to witnesses on shore (5.4), but had he arranged flight-following and made a timely emergency radio call, his rescue might have been more assured (5.4). This emphasizes the importance of flight planning and communication as a safety theme.
