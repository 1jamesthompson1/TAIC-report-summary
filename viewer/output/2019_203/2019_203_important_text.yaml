  \ Securing  logs on the deck of a ship can be a hazardous task that requires good\
  \ \ncommunication and co -ordination of skills between the people involved.  \n\
  3.2 At the time of the accident , the chief officer and the boatswain were being\
  \ assisted by \ntwo ABs to secure the deck log  cargo above number two hatch.  \n\
  3.3 The team securing the deck logs had all completed th e task numerous times before\
  \ . \nBoth the chief officer and the boatswain were charged with overseeing the\
  \ operation \nand had considerable experience.   \n3.4 The two ABs who were  struck\
  \  by the securing equipment had been tasked with check ing \nwhen the tension in\
  \ the wiggle wire was sufficient.  \n3.5 The following section analyses the failure\
  \ of the foot wire and the subse quent fatality of \nthe AB. It also examines the\
  \ conduct of the cargo -securing operation and associated \nprocedures.  \nFailure\
  \ of the foot wire  \n3.6 Both sections  of the foot wire that parted were removed\
  \  by the Commission  from the \nvessel . Experts were appointed to conduct a  thorough\
  \ metall urgic examination of the \nparted wire (see Figure 6) and to carry out\
  \ a destructive load test on the remaining \nsection of the foot wire .  \nMetallurgical\
  \ examination  \n3.7 The foot wire was inspected by a metallurgic engineer , who\
  \ concluded in part:  \nThe failure of the rope most likely occurred as a result\
  \ of overload. The failed \nwires exhibited necking and a cu p and cone fracture\
  \ face that is typical o f this \ntype of failure.  \nAlthough some corrosion had\
  \ occurred it is considered unlikely that corrosion of \nthe rope was the primary\
  \ cause of the failure . \n3.8 The elements of the failure mechanism described by\
  \ the enginee r can be seen in Figure 7, \nand the relevant section of the report\
  \ is contained in Appendix 1.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2019 -203 \n<< Page 11 >>\n\

  \ 7: Macro photograph of the failed foot wire showing  reduction  (necking)  \n\
  and cup and cone failure face  \nDestructive test  \n3.9 On completion of the visual\
  \ examination , the foot wire was tested to destruction16 to \ndetermine its breaking\
  \ load at the time of the accident.  This test concluded that the load \nrequired\
  \ to part the wire was 26.21 tonne s. The certificate of testing can be found  in\
  \ \nAppendix 2.  \n3.10 The Commission found that the breaking strength of the parted\
  \ foot wire at the time of \nthe accident had not been significantly reduced since\
  \ its manufacture in 2014.  \n                                                 \n\

  \ In the absence of any defect being identified in the foot wire, it was li kely\
  \ that the crane \nwas applying a load  that resulted in the foot wire being overloaded\
  \ and  parting.  \n \nFigure 8: Diagram showing the configuration  of the blocks\
  \  on the day of the accident  \nWhy the foot wire was overloaded  \n3.12 An o verload\
  \ of a wire occurs when the axial load exce eds the breaking load17. The \nvessel's\
  \ cargo securing manual stated th at to minimise the likelihood of wire overload\
  \ \noccurring, re -useable wires were considered to have a maximum securing load\
  \ of 30% of \ntheir certified breaking load. In the case of the foot wire this was\
  \ 8.2 tonnes, which \nallowed a margin of safety of 19.2 tonnes.  The maximum securing\
  \ load of the foot wire \nwas not recorded in the vessel 's cargo securing manual\
  \ and the crew were unaware of \nthe value when interviewed. This increased the\
  \ risk of  the crew inadvertently exceeding \nthe breaking load of the foot wire.\
  \  \n3.13 The cargo securing manual on the Coresky OL  also showed how the securing\
  \ equipment  \n(see Figure 4) was to be configured to apply a binding effect on\
  \ the logs.  \n3.14 At the time of the accident, the securing equipment was configured\
  \ to allow the crew to \nattach bulldog grips and secure the tensioned wiggle wire\
  \ between the first and second \n                                              \

  \ foot wire s (see Figure 8). The first foot wire had two blocks attached to it.\
  \ This resulted in \nthe first foot wire having a load of three to four times the\
  \ load being applied by the \ncrane  to the wiggle wire  (see Figure 8). Therefore,\
  \ the crane needed to apply between \n6.55 and 8.7 tonnes to the wiggle wire to\
  \ overload the foot wire. The crew were unaware  \nthat the foot wire was experiencing\
  \ a load three to four times greater  than the load \nbeing applied by the crane.\
  \ This increased the risk of the crew inadvertently exceeding \nthe breaking load\
  \ of the foot wire.  \n3.15 The diagram in the guidance material also sho wed turnbuckles\
  \ (see Figure 4) between \nthe wiggle wire and the foot wire s. Turnbuckles allow\
  \ tension to be increased or \ndecreased manually in a controlled manner. Howev\
  \ er, at the time of the accident \nturnbuckles had not been rigged between the\
  \ wiggle wire and the foot wires.  Instead, \nblocks had been attached directly\
  \ to the foot wires.  As a result, it was not possible to \nincrease the tension\
  \ in the wiggle wire  manually  after the initial tension had been \napplied. If\
  \ turnbuckles had been rigged, it would have been unnecessary for the crane to \n\
  apply more than just the initial tension and reduced the likelihood of a foot wire\
  \ \nbecoming overloaded.   \n3.16 By not rigging turnbuckles o n the day of the\
  \ accident, it was necessary for the crew to \nuse the ship's crane to apply sufficient\
  \ tension in the wiggle wire to bind the logs \nsecurely. The ABs, whose role was\
  \ to monitor the tension, had no way of determining \nhow much tension was in the\
  \  wire other than by feel. This required them to 'step' on the \nwiggle wire. \
  \ For the two ABs to be able to 'step' on the wiggle wire, it was necessary for\
  \ \nthem to stand in a hazardous area close to a wire under tension.  This exposed\
  \ them to \nconsiderable risk  from the failure of any part of the securing  equipment\
  \ that was under \ntension.  \n3.17 It is usual, before commencing work of this\
  \ sort in a hazardous environment, for the \nperson in charge of the operation to\
  \ hold a pre -work safety meeting or 'toolbox talk'.  \nSuch meetings were not routinely\
  \ held on  board  the Coresky OL.  Had a meeting been \nheld before this securing\
  \  operation commenced , it would have provided an opportunity \nfor the team to\
  \ discuss the safety implications of crew standing in hazardous areas \nwher e wires\
  \ and associated securing  equipment were under tension.  Although the crew \nhad\
  \ carried out this task many times before , a pre-work safety meeting might  have\
  \ \nprompted them to think of alternative solutions to standing in a hazardous place\
  \ , \nincluding th e recommended use of turnbuckles to reduce the amount of tension\
  \ \nrequired in the wiggle wire.  \nSafety management  \nSafety issue: The operator's\
  \ safety management system was not supported by an effective safety \nassessment\
  \ of log -cargo -securing operations, whi ch should have identified the hazards\
  \ present. \nThis resulted in ineffective controls to mitigate the risk s to crew\
  \ when completing these tasks.  \n3.18 A safety management system (SMS) is defined\
  \ in the International Safety Management \nCode as \" a structured and do cumented\
  \ system enabling company personnel to \nimplement effectively the company safety\
  \ and environmental protection policy\" . A \nmature SMS should include but not\
  \ be limited to:  \n\uF0B7 operating procedures  \n\uF0B7 role responsibilities\
  \  \n\uF0B7 review and audit requirements  \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO\
  \ -2019 -203 \uF0B7 training requirements  \n\uF0B7 identifying risks to personnel\
  \ and establish ing appropriate safeguards . \n3.19 Incorporated within the operator's\
  \ SMS was the vessel 's cargo securing manual , which \ncontained technical instructions\
  \ for the crew in respect of securing deck log cargo.   \nOperating procedures for\
  \ securing  cargo  \n3.20 The cargo securing manual contained a copy of the IMO\
  \ 's 'Code of Safe Practice for \nShips Carrying Timber Deck Cargoes - 1991'.  However,\
  \ the most current version of the \ncode had been  adopted on 30 November 201 1.\
  \ \n3.21 A number of changes had been  made to the code between 1991 and 2011. \
  \ Significantly , \nthe 2011 version of the code explained:  \n\uF0B7 the need for\
  \ turnbuckles to be rigged between wiggle wires and foot wires  \n\uF0B7 that a\
  \ crane or winch was to be used only to apply the initial tension to wiggle wires\
  \ . \n3.22 An extract from the 2011 edition of the code , explaining the arrangement\
  \ for wiggle \nwires , is shown in Figure 9. \n \nFigure 9: Extract from the 2011\
  \ Code of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber Deck Cargo s \n \n3.23 The explicit\
  \ reference to apply only the initial tension would have provided the crew with\
  \ \nthe guidance necessary to minimise the likelihood of inadvertent overload and\
  \ reinforce \nthe need to use turnbuckles, which would have allow ed the crew to\
  \ better assess the \namount of tension throughout the securing system . \n3.24\
  \ The implementation of the 2011 version of the code, and the procedural changes\
  \ \ncontained within  it, would  have also prompted the operator to conduct a review\
  \  of the \nlog-securing operation  and update procedures and instructions within\
  \ the SMS.  \n3.25 Although the vessel's SMS had been audited by the classification\
  \ society and by internal \nauditors, the audits had not identified that the vessel\
  \ was using an out -of-date IMO \nCode of Safe Practice for Ships Carrying Timber\
  \ Deck Cargoes. As a result , the \n\nFinal Report MO -2019 -203 \n<< Page 15 >>\n\
  \ amendments contained in the 2011 code, which would have made the operation safer,\
  \ \nhad not been incorporated into onboard procedures.   \nRisk-assessing the log\
  \ -securing operation  \n3.26 The operator's SMS required the  crew to undertake\
  \ an initial risk assessment before \nsecuring  the deck log cargo. The SMS instructed\
  \ the crew to carry out a second , detailed \nrisk assessment if the initial risk\
  \ assessment identified any \"significant risks\" .  \n3.27 Evidence showed that\
  \ previous initial and detailed risk assessments carried out by the \ncrew for deck\
  \ log cargo operations had each identified the same hazards.  The \nassessments\
  \ carried out on the day of the accident were no different.  The detailed risk \n\
  assessment, of which an extract is shown in Table 1, did not identify any additional\
  \ \nhazards.   \nHazard  Mitigation  Likelihood  Consequence  \nSkids and falls\

  \  High  \nTable 1: 'Detailed risk assessment ' content from vessel  \n \n3.28 There\
  \ were more  significant hazards present in the securing  operation that were not\
  \ \nidentified , such as the potential hazard of wires under tension parting.  \
  \ \n3.29 Although the cargo securing manual provided technical guidance and drawings\
  \ on how \nlog cargo was to be secured  on the deck , it did not provide a safe\
  \ operating procedure \nfor the crew to follow. The development of a safe operating\
  \ pr ocedure was the \nresponsibility of the operator and should have involved a\
  \ fulsome risk assessment. \nBecause the operator had not undertaken such an assessment\
  \ for log -securing  \noperations , there was no guidance contained in the SMS about\
  \ the dangers associat ed \nwith wires under tension,  the potential for load multiplication,\
  \  snap back zones18 or safe \nareas to stand when a crane was being used to heav\
  \ e on the wiggle wire . This likely \ncontributed to the crew involved in this\
  \ accident not identifying this hazard during their \nrisk assessments  or impl\
  \ ementing appropriate mitigations . \n                                        \
  \         \n18 The predicted trajectories of lengths of rope  or wire  from their\
  \ point s of failure . \n \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2019 -203 3.30 A\
  \ fulsome  assessment  by the operator would have likely provided it with the  opportunity\
  \ \nto implement more effective mitigation  measures for the hazard s of the log-cargo\
  \ -\nsecuring operati on. Doing so would have helped to ensure that  a safe r system\
  \ of work \nwas established  and that the crew were exposed to fewer  risks. The\
  \ Commission has \ntherefore made a recommendation to the operator to carry out\
  \ such an assessment.   \nProvision of information to crew  \n3.31 The cargo securing\
  \ manual provided the crew with some of the information they \nrequired . However,\
  \ the  crew would still have had to calculate the safe working load of \nloose -cargo\
  \ -securing gear  calculate the load being applied to the foot wires through the\
  \ \nconfiguration of the blocks, and then produce a risk -mitigation plan.  \n3.32\
  \ This was a task more suited to being conducted by the operator, before the vessel\
  \ \ncommenced operations, using experts familiar with the methodology of the securing\
  \  \noperation and the loads likely to be imparted.   \n \nFinal Report MO -2019\
