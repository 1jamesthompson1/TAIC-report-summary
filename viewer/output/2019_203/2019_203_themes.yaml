- name: Overloading of Securing Equipment
  explanation: Overloading of securing equipment is a safety theme that emerged from the accident, where the foot wire was subjected to a load exceeding its breaking strength. The metallurgical examination concluded that "the failure of the rope most likely occurred as a result of overload" (3.7). Additionally, the destructive test showed that the load required to part the wire was 26.21 tonnes, and the foot wire was not significantly weakened since its manufacture, indicating that the crane was applying a load that resulted in the foot wire being overloaded and parting (3.9, 3.10, 3.11). This theme is relevant because it directly contributed to the equipment failure that led to the accident.
- name: Lack of Awareness of Load Limits
  explanation: The crew's lack of awareness of the load limits and the actual loads being applied during the securing operation is a safety theme in this accident. The cargo securing manual did not record the maximum securing load of the foot wire, and the crew were unaware of the value when interviewed, increasing the risk of inadvertently exceeding the breaking load (3.12). Furthermore, the crew did not realize that the foot wire was experiencing a load three to four times greater than the load being applied by the crane (3.14). This lack of awareness is relevant because it prevented the crew from recognizing the risk of overloading and taking appropriate precautions.
- name: Inadequate Use of Equipment
  explanation: The inadequate use of equipment, specifically the absence of turnbuckles, is another safety theme. The accident occurred in part because turnbuckles, which allow tension to be increased or decreased manually, were not rigged between the wiggle wire and the foot wires (3.15). Instead, the crane was used to apply tension, which increased the risk of overloading the foot wire. The crew's reliance on the crane for tensioning, without a means to measure the tension, exposed them to the risk of equipment failure (3.16). This theme is relevant as the proper use of turnbuckles could have prevented the need for excessive tension applied by the crane and reduced the likelihood of overloading.
- name: Ineffective Safety Management Systems
  explanation: The operator's ineffective safety management system (SMS) is a safety theme that contributed to the accident. The SMS did not support an effective safety assessment of log-cargo-securing operations, which should have identified the hazards present (3.18). The audits did not identify the use of an out-of-date IMO Code of Safe Practice, resulting in missed amendments that would have made the operation safer (3.25). The lack of a fulsome risk assessment meant there was no guidance on the dangers associated with wires under tension or safe areas to stand when a crane was being used (3.29). This theme is relevant because an effective SMS would have provided the necessary guidance and controls to mitigate the risks to the crew.
- name: Insufficient Pre-Work Safety Meetings
  explanation: The absence of routine pre-work safety meetings, or 'toolbox talks', is a safety theme that reflects a missed opportunity for the crew to discuss safety implications and consider alternative solutions to standing in hazardous places (3.17). Such meetings could have prompted the use of recommended turnbuckles to reduce the amount of tension required in the wiggle wire, potentially avoiding the accident. This theme is relevant as it highlights a lack of procedural safeguards that could have enhanced crew awareness and safety during hazardous operations.
- name: Inadequate Risk Assessment and Mitigation
  explanation: Inadequate risk assessment and mitigation is a safety theme where the crew's risk assessments did not identify significant hazards such as the potential for wires under tension to part (3.28). The SMS did not provide a safe operating procedure for the crew to follow, and the operator had not undertaken a fulsome risk assessment for log-securing operations (3.29). This theme is relevant because a comprehensive risk assessment would have likely identified the hazards and allowed for the implementation of effective mitigation measures, reducing the risks to the crew.
