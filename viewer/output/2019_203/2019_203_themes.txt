Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Overload of the foot wire: The foot wire failed as a result of overload, causing the securing equipment to strike an able-bodied seaman. The load being applied by the crane, when multiplied by the configuration of the blocks, was sufficient to overload the foot wire.

2. Lack of proper procedures and equipment: Turnbuckles were not rigged between the wiggle wire and foot wires, which meant that the crane was used to tension the wiggle wire. The crew did not identify the hazards associated with wires under tension and had not implemented appropriate mitigation measures. The cargo securing manual did not provide guidance on a safe system of work for cargo-securing operations.

3. Ineffective safety management system: The operator's safety management system did not include a safety assessment of cargo-securing operations. This resulted in ineffective controls to mitigate the risks to the crew when completing these tasks. The operator had not undertaken a fulsome risk assessment for log-securing operations, leading to a lack of guidance on the dangers associated with wires under tension and other hazards.
