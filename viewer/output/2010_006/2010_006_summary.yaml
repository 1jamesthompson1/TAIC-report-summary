- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no evidence in the document that fatigue played a role in the incident. The examination of the Avsec officer's duty time and rest pattern did not suggest that fatigue contributed to the incident (4.6).
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The Avsec officer made an assumption that by making a radio call he had the right of way to the runway and displayed little appreciation for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation (4.9). This assumption and lack of situational awareness significantly contributed to the incident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The Avsec officer had not been trained to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules, particularly in understanding the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting (4.13). This lack of training contributed to the officer's decision to enter the runway without ensuring it was clear.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention in the document of issues related to training and familiarity with equipment contributing to the incident.

- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in this incident as there is no mention of teamwork, communication, decision-making, or leadership issues within a crew context in the document.

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The Avsec officer did not adhere to safety procedures by entering the runway without ensuring it was not in use and without an ATC clearance (4.10, 4.12). The established unauthorized practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable also indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures (4.4).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The lack of clear procedures for situations when Avsec officers might need to enter the runway when ATC was unavailable suggests issues with the organizational safety culture (4.15). Additionally, the established unauthorized practice of using the runway outside ATC hours indicates a culture that may not prioritize safety (4.4).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 10
  explanation: There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before entering the runway outside normal hours of ATC, which is a missed opportunity in risk management (4.7).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The Avsec officer's actions were not in compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules, which require ensuring the runway is clear before entering (4.13). However, there is no direct mention of a failure in regulatory oversight as a contributing factor.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The Avsec officer's lack of situational awareness, as evidenced by not expecting any aircraft movements at that time and not appreciating that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active, contributed to the incident (4.13).
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention in the document of emergency response preparedness being a factor in the incident.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes

  explanation: 'There is no mention in the document of automation being a factor in the incident.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Weather conditions, specifically heavy rain and darkness, reduced visibility and contributed to the pilots not seeing the vehicle on the runway (4.4). However, the weather did not directly cause the Avsec officer to enter the runway.
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 0
  explanation: Although the Avsec officer did make a radio call before entering the runway, the pilots did not hear it, possibly due to the critical phase of flight they were in (4.4). However, the document does not suggest that communication breakdown was a significant contributing factor to the incident.
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There are no additional safety themes identified in the document that contributed to the incident.
