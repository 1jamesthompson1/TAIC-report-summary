  \ ab out when an Avsec officer drove his patrol \nvehicle onto the active runway\
  \ at night in heavy rain ahead of an aeroplane that had just \nlanded.  Fortunately\
  \ there was no collision becaus e the vehicle was not driven to the centre of \n\
  the runway, but instead it remained on the runway shoulder and came to a stop as\
  \ the \naeroplane passed. \n4.2. There were no issues identified with the oper ation\
  \ of the aircraft, so  the discussion that \nfollows looks at the individual and\
  \ systemic issu es that allowed the Avsec vehicle to enter the \nrunway in front\
  \ of a landing aircraft. \nThe aeroplane \n4.3. The incident occurred outside the\
  \ hours of operation of Dunedin control tower, so no ATC \nservices were available.\
  \  The aeroplane crew  had made the standard radio calls for an \nunattended aerodrome,\
  \ advising the local traffi c on the correct radio frequency several times \nof\
  \ their intentions.  The crew were aware of the actual weather conditions from the\
  \ reports of \nthe airport night security agent, and commenced the instrument approach\
  \ confident that they \ncould land off the approach.  When they broke out of cloud\
  \ at about 600 feet (300 feet above the minimum altitude) and had the runway lights\
  \  in sight and no visible obstruction on the \nrunway, they had every reason to\
  \ continue the approach and land.  At that stage the Avsec \nofficer's vehicle was\
  \ not near the runway. \n4.4. The Avsec officer did make a radio call immediatel\
  \ y prior to entering the runway, but the pilots \ndid not hear it.  Although the\
  \ exact timing of events could not be determined, it is almost \ncertain that the\
  \ pilots were engaged in the critic al touchdown phase of flight and that the radio\
  \ \ncall could have been masked by the noise of th e aeroplane engines being selected\
  \ to reverse \nthrust after landing.  Once reverse thrust had been selected, the\
  \ pilots, if they had seen a \nvehicle enter the runway, could only have steered\
  \ the aeroplane to avoid a collision.  A go-\naround at that point would not have\
  \ been a viable option to prevent a collision.  The \ncombination of rain and darkness\
  \ reduced the visibility to the extent that the pilots did not see \nthe vehicle\
  \ on the runway and were unaware of the high collision risk until later. \nThe patrol\
  \ vehicle \n4.5. The Avsec officer stated duty at 0600.  When he turned on the patrol\
  \ vehicle radio several \nminutes later, the aeroplane would have been es tablished\
  \ on the final approach and the first \nofficer would have made the last of his\
  \ radio calls, advising of their intention to land on \nrunway 21.  Consequently\
  \ the Avsec officer cou ld not have heard the ra dio calls.  Having not \nliaised\
  \ with the airport company night security agent, the Avsec officer did not know\
  \ about the \nimpending aircraft arrival. \n4.6. An examination of the Avsec officer's\
  \ duty time and rest pattern did not suggest that fatigue \ncontributed to the incident.\
  \ \n4.7. There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night\
  \ security agent for \nany expected aircraft movements before the o fficer entered\
  \ the runway outside the normal \nhours of ATC, because the need for Avsec vehicl\
  \ es to enter the aircraft manoeuvring area in \nsuch circumstances had not been\
  \ anticipated.  Had there been such a procedure, the Avsec \nofficer would have\
  \ been alerted to the unusual arrival time and would have been unlikely to \nconsider\
  \ using the runway to attempt the peri meter inspection.  The lack of procedure\
  \ was \none missed opportunity that could have averted the near collision. \n4.8.\
  \ When the Avsec officer drove past  the night security agent, the agent did not\
  \ consider that the \nofficer would drive onto the runway.  Althou gh there were\
  \ about 25 seconds between the \npatrol vehicle passing the night security agent\
  \ and when the vehicle crossed the holding point \nfor the runway, the agent did\
  \ not know the Avsec officer's intentions, because he had not \nheard the officer's\
  \ radio call.  The agent was th erefore surprised and had no time to intervene \n\
  once he realised the vehicle was entering the runway.  The rain and reflected lights\
  \ also \nreduced the agent's ability to assess the position of the Avsec vehicle.\
  \ \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Report 10-006 4.9. The Avsec officer knew that he had to make\
  \ a radio call, but it would seem that he assumed \nthat by having made the call\
  \ he had the righ t of way to the runway.  He displayed little \nappreciation of\
  \ the fact that there could be several other participants who needed time to \n\
  receive, acknowledge and build a mental picture of the effects of his intention\
  \ to enter the \nrunway.  In this case the landing aircraft was close to, if not\
  \ already, landing when the Avsec \nofficer made his call.  The Avsec officer's\
  \ actions were indicative of a 'tunnel' focus on completing his own tasks with little\
  \ regard for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation. \n4.10.  The Avsec officer\
  \ had a responsibility to ensu re that the runway was not being used, or \nintended\
  \ to be used, by any aircraft before he entered it and he was required to give way\
  \ to all aircraft moving on the runway, taxiway or apron.  It is a requirement and\
  \ good aviation practice \nfor pilots to check in both directions before moving\
  \ their aircraft onto runways, even when \ngiven permission to do so by ATC.  Drivers\
  \ of  airport vehicles should be similarly trained and \nrequired to follow this\
  \ good practice.  The Avsec officer said that he looked left before entering \n\
  the runway, but he did not stop his vehicle before doing so.  In spite of the rain\
  \ and possible reflections of his own lights off the standing wate r, the aircraft\
  \ landing lights should have been \nvisible to a careful observer.  If the environm\
  \ ental conditions had not allowed an effective \nsearch of the runway and approaches,\
  \ he should not have entered the runway. \n4.11.  Local practice was for the airport\
  \ perimeter fenc e check to be completed before the start of \ndomestic screening,\
  \ but it cou ld have been delayed until daylig ht, which was logically a better\
  \ \ntime to achieve the check.  It was not unusual for patrols to use the runway\
  \ for conducting the \ncheck outside ATC hours of operation, particular ly during\
  \ the winter months, but the practice \nwas not standardised so created an un necessary\
  \ risk to airport operations. \n4.12.  Because the Avsec and airport company procedures\
  \ had made no provision for vehicles to \nenter the runway without an ATC clearance,\
  \ vehicles should not have entered the runway \noutside the hours of operation of\
  \ ATC, except in the case of an emergency.  The flooded \nperimeter track was not\
  \ an emergency situation, but the established unauthorised practice of \nusing the\
  \ runway at such times would have influenced the Avsec officer's decision to enter\
  \ the \nrunway. \n4.13.  The Avsec officer's decision was also probably influenced\
  \ by his not expecting any aircraft \nmovements at that time.  The officer did not\
  \ appr eciate that flights could be delayed or that \naircraft movements could occur\
  \ at any time, nor did he appreciate that the illuminated runway \nlights meant\
  \ the runway was active and an aircraft was about to land or to depart.  This lack\
  \ of \nawareness, together with the speed with which he entered the runway without\
  \ conducting an \neffective visual check to ensure it was clear, su ggested that\
  \ the officer had not been trained in \nthese aspects to the standard requir ed\
  \ by the Civil Aviation Rules. \n4.14.  Had there been a pre-duty briefing with\
  \ the senior Avsec officer or a team meeting, and \nestablished procedures for entering\
  \ the runway  when the control tower was not operational, \nthe Avsec officer would\
  \ likely have delayed his decision to carry out the perimeter fence check \nuntil\
  \ after the control tower was operational.  The procedures should have required\
  \ him to \ncheck first with his supervisor, and have been expl icit in requiring\
  \ drivers to come to a stop at \nthe holding point for a thorough look along the\
  \ runway before proceeding.  Had such a \nrequirement existed, it is more likely\
  \ than no t that the officer would have seen the aeroplane \nlights and not entered\
  \ the runway. \nSummary  \n4.15.  This was a serious runway incursion and a collisi\
  \ on was fortuitously narrowly avoided.  The \nheavy rain and consequent flooding\
  \ of the peri meter track combined with the lack of clear \nprocedures to cover\
  \ situations when Avsec offi cers might need to enter the runway when ATC \nwas\
  \ unavailable to create the opportunity for the incident. \n4.16.  \nHad the Avsec\
  \ officer had a more \"thorough knowledge of the operational environment\", \nincluding\
  \ the meaning of the aerodrome lighting, the incident would likely not have occurred.\
  \ \n4.17.  As Avsec and Dunedin International Airport Limite d took the safety actions\
  \ shown in Section 6 \nto help prevent a recurrence, the Commi ssion did not make\
  \ any recommendation. \n \nReport 10-006 \n<< Page 11 >>"
