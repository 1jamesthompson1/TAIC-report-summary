","0.0","20.0","The Avsec officer made an assumption that by making a radio call he had the right of way to the runway and displayed little appreciation for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation (4.9). This assumption and lack of situational awareness significantly contributed to the incident.
","0.0","18.333","The Avsec officer had not been trained to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules, particularly in understanding the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting (4.13). This lack of training contributed to the officer's decision to enter the runway without ensuring it was clear.

","0.0","0.0","Crew Resource Management does not appear to be a factor in this incident as there is no mention of teamwork, communication, decision-making, or leadership issues within a crew context in the document.
","0.0","16.667","The Avsec officer did not adhere to safety procedures by entering the runway without ensuring it was not in use and without an ATC clearance (4.10, 4.12). The established unauthorized practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable also indicates a lack of adherence to safety procedures (4.4).
","2.887","10.0","The lack of clear procedures for situations when Avsec officers might need to enter the runway when ATC was unavailable suggests issues with the organizational safety culture (4.15). Additionally, the established unauthorized practice of using the runway outside ATC hours indicates a culture that may not prioritize safety (4.4).
","0.0","10.0","There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before entering the runway outside normal hours of ATC, which is a missed opportunity in risk management (4.7).
","0.0","5.0","The Avsec officer's actions were not in compliance with the Civil Aviation Rules, which require ensuring the runway is clear before entering (4.13). However, there is no direct mention of a failure in regulatory oversight as a contributing factor.
","0.0","13.333","The Avsec officer's lack of situational awareness, as evidenced by not expecting any aircraft movements at that time and not appreciating that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active, contributed to the incident (4.13).
