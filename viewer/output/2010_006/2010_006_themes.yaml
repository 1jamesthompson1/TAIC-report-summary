- name: Communication Procedures
  explanation: Communication procedures are critical for ensuring that all parties operating within an airport environment are aware of each other's actions and intentions. This theme is relevant to the accident because the Avsec officer made a radio call before entering the runway, but the pilots did not hear it, likely due to being engaged in the critical touchdown phase of flight ("the avsec officer did make a radio call immediately prior to entering the runway, but the pilots did not hear it" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). Furthermore, the Avsec officer assumed that by making the call, he had the right of way to the runway, showing a lack of understanding of the need for communication to be received and acknowledged by others ("The Avsec officer knew that he had to make a radio call, but it would seem that he assumed that by having made the call he had the right of way to the runway" (4.9)).
- name: Training and Awareness
  explanation: Training and awareness of airport operations and procedures are essential for all personnel to ensure the safety of airport operations. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer lacked a thorough knowledge of the operational environment, including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting, which contributed to the incident ("Had the Avsec officer had a more 'thorough knowledge of the operational environment', including the meaning of the aerodrome lighting, the incident would likely not have occurred" (4.16)). Additionally, the officer had not been trained to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules, which would have included an understanding that illuminated runway lights indicated an active runway ("This lack of awareness, together with the speed with which he entered the runway without conducting an effective visual check to ensure it was clear, suggested that the officer had not been trained in these aspects to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Rules" (4.13)).
- name: Procedural Compliance
  explanation: Adherence to established procedures is a fundamental aspect of aviation safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because there was no procedure for Avsec officers to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before entering the runway outside normal hours of ATC, which was a missed opportunity that could have averted the near collision ("There was no procedure for an Avsec officer to check with the airport night security agent for any expected aircraft movements before the officer entered the runway outside the normal hours of ATC" (4.7)). Moreover, the Avsec officer's decision to enter the runway was influenced by an established unauthorized practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable, which was against the airport company's procedures ("A factor contributing to the Avsec officer's decision to enter the runway was the established unauthorised practice of using the runway when the perimeter road was unusable" (5.4)).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness involves understanding the current and future states of the environment to make informed decisions. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer did not appreciate that flights could be delayed or that aircraft movements could occur at any time, nor did he understand that the illuminated runway lights meant the runway was active ("The Avsec officer's decision was also probably influenced by his not expecting any aircraft movements at that time" (4.13)). The officer's tunnel focus on completing his own tasks with little regard for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation also indicates a lack of situational awareness ("The Avsec officer's actions were indicative of a 'tunnel' focus on completing his own tasks with little regard for the bigger picture of the aerodrome operation" (4.9)).
- name: Coordination Between Personnel
  explanation: Effective coordination between personnel is necessary to ensure that all operational activities are conducted safely and in harmony. This theme is relevant because the Avsec officer did not liaise with the airport company night security agent and was therefore unaware of the impending aircraft arrival ("Having not liaised with the airport company night security agent, the Avsec officer did not know about the impending aircraft arrival" (4.5)). Additionally, the absence of a procedure to allow access to the runway when ATC was not in attendance and no requirement for a pre-shift briefing or coordination with the airport company meant that the Avsec officer was inadequately prepared to make the proper decision about entering the runway ("The absence of a procedure to allow access to the runway when ATC was not in attendance, and no requirement for a pre-shift briefing or co-ordination with the airport company meant that the Avsec officer was inadequately prepared" (5.5)).
- name: Environmental Conditions
  explanation: Environmental conditions, such as weather, can significantly impact visibility and the ability to detect hazards. This theme is relevant because the heavy rain and darkness reduced visibility to the extent that the pilots did not see the vehicle on the runway and were unaware of the high collision risk until later ("the combination of rain and darkness reduced the visibility to the extent that the pilots did not see the vehicle on the runway" (4.4 (invalid formatted quote))). The rain and reflected lights also reduced the night security agent's ability to assess the position of the Avsec vehicle, which contributed to the incident ("The rain and reflected lights also reduced the agent's ability to assess the position of the Avsec vehicle" (4.8)).
