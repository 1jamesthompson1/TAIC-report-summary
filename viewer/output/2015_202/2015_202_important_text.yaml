  \ an accommodation ladder for use is a routine task carried out many time s a day\
  \ \nacross the world on vessels of all sizes.  It is not unusual for  a crew to\
  \ prepare t he \naccommodation ladder before a ship arrives at the dock.  This requires\
  \ them to work outside \nthe rail (often referred to as 'over the side ').  Having\
  \ c rew members work over the side is a risk \nthat has been widely recognised by\
  \ the industry for many decad es. \n4.1.2.  In 2014 the U nited Kingdom  P&I Club8\
  \ issued Technical Bulletin Number 42/2014 , which  \nstated:  \nThe UK Club's claims\
  \ statistics show that many serious injuries (or deaths) are \ncaused by falls from\
  \ gangways  or embarkation ladders. The Club's risk assessors \nfrequently visit\
  \ ships where these are badly rigged, in a poor condition or witness \ndangerous\
  \ working practices.  Many accidents occur during the rigging of the \ngangway .\
  \ The process of rigging the stanchio ns and the side ropes is inherently \ndangerous\
  \ as there can be little for crew members to hold on to until this is \ncompleted.\
  \ Crew should always wear a safety harness and lifejacket during this \noperation.\
  \ Securing of the safety harness line can sometimes be  difficult as there \ncan\
  \ be little to clip on to and movement can be restricted by the length of the \n\
  harness line.  \n4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses the circumstances of what\
  \ happened in this case.  It also \ndiscusses the following issues:  \n\uF0B7 The\
  \ lack of a consi stent procedure for rigging a n accommodation ladder  while still\
  \ at sea  \n\uF0B7 The design and failure of the wire that the bosun had connected\
  \ his safety harness to  \n\uF0B7 The shipboard emergency response to the bosun\
  \ falling into the sea  \n4.2. What happened  \n4.2.1.  When the bosun and  the\
  \ deck trainee went to prepare the accommodation ladder the bosun \nwas aware of\
  \ the need for the correct personal protective equipment.  Both he and the deck\
  \ \ntrainee were wearing their safety harnesses, and he had sent the deck trainee\
  \ to retrieve their \nbuoyancy vests from the crew changing room.  \n4.2.2.  While\
  \ the deck trainee went to collect the buoyancy vests, the bosun started unlashing\
  \ the \naccommodation ladder , swinging it out and  lowering it to a level  where\
  \ the handrails could be \nrigge d.  This part of the o peration could be accomplished\
  \ safely from the vessel's deck \nbecause it did not require him to go over the\
  \ side.  \n4.2.3.  However,  he then  walked out onto the accommodation ladder ,\
  \ connected his safety harness \nonto the plastic -coated wire rope and attempt\
  \ ed to rig the handrail s without waiting for the \ndeck trainee to return with\
  \ the buoyancy vests.  \n4.2.4.  Rigging the handrails was usually  a two -man operation.\
  \  The handrail s comprise a long \naluminium pipe supported by pivoting stanchions\
  \ along its length.  The geometry  of the \nhandrail is such that when one end is\
  \ lifted it tends to cause the other end to \"dig in\".  Normal \npractice on board\
  \ was to use two crew members to raise both ends simultaneously.  Lifting the \n\
  hand rail  from  the middle cause s both ends to \"dig in\" a nd results in the\
  \ handrail snapping \nback down , in this case with sufficient force to cause the\
  \ bosun to lose his balance and fall off \nthe accommodation ladder.  \n4.2.5. \
  \ It is unclear  why the bosun walked out onto the accommodation ladder without\
  \ waiting for the \ndeck trainee to return with his buoyanc y vest.  He possibly\
  \ felt secure in the fact that he was \n                                       \
  \                 \n8 Protection and indemnity insu rance, more commonly known as\
  \ 'P&I' insurance, is a form of mutual maritime insurance \nprovided by a P&I Club.\
  \  Whereas a marine insurance  company provides 'hull and machinery ' cover for\
  \ ship  owners, and \ncargo cover for cargo owners, a P&I Club provides cover for\
  \ open -ended risks that traditional insurers are reluctant to \ninsure  (Anderson,\
  \ 1999) . \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report MO -2015 -202 wearing a safety harness\
  \ and would not therefore fall into the sea.   However, the wire he \nclipped on\
  \  to was not of sufficient strength to arrest his fall.  \n4.2.6.  Accordin g to\
  \ studies of 'human factors' , individual actions can be classified in several ways;\
  \ in \n1990 James Reason proposed some distinctions that have become widely accepted.\
  \  Firstly, \nhe made an important distinction between two broad groups of individual\
  \ actio ns that \nincrease risk (Walker, 2004) .   \n\uF0B7 Errors : those occasions\
  \ in which an individual's planned sequence of \nmental or physical activities fails\
  \ to achieve their intended outcomes, and \nwhen these failures cannot be attributed\
  \ to the intervention of some \nchance agency (Reason, 1990) . \n\uF0B7 Violations\
  \ : deliberate deviations from an organisation's safety procedures \ndrawn up for\
  \ the safe or efficient operation and maintenance of plant or \nequipment (Health\
  \ and Safety Executive, 1995) . \n4.2.7.  In this case the non -wearing of a personal\
  \ flotation device appeared to be an exceptional \nviolation.  Exceptional violations\
  \ appear as isolated departures from authority, not necessarily \nindicative of\
  \ individuals' typical behaviour patterns or condoned by management (Reason, \n\
  1990) .  They are not considered exceptional because of their extreme nature; rather\
  \ they are \nconsidered exceptional because they are neither typical of the individuals\
  \ nor condoned by \nauthority.  What makes exceptional violations particularly difficult\
  \ for an o rganisation to deal \nwith is that they are not indicative of individuals'\
  \ behavioural repertoire and, as such, are \nparticularly difficult to predict.\
  \  Usually when individuals are confronted with evidence of their \nbehaviour and\
  \ asked to explain it, they are  left with little explanation (Shappell & Wiegmann,\
  \ \n2000) . \n4.3. Failure of the wire to arrest the bosun's fall  \n4.3.1.  The\
  \ wire to which  the bosun attached his safety harness was plastic coated.  It was\
  \ rigged \nbetween two eye  bolts that ha d been fitted to the accommodation ladder\
  \ suspension \narrangement (see Figures 4 and 5).   \n4.3.2.  There was no record\
  \ on board the Madinah  of when and who  had fitted the eye  bolts.  Each of \n\
  the four accommodation ladders (one either side of the accommodation and on e either\
  \ side at \nthe pilot boarding station on the main deck) fitted on the Madinah \
  \ had been similarly \nmodified.  However , only the port -side accommodation ladder\
  \ had a wire strung between the \neye bolts.  \n4.3.3.  This wire was removed from\
  \ the vessel after the acci dent and sent for examination and testing \nby an independent\
  \ contractor engaged by the Commission.  The independent contractor \nreported that\
  \ the \"wire rope was a 6 x 19 right hand regular lay galvanised steel wire rope\
  \ with \nfibre core of approximately 8 mm diameter. The rope was sheathed with a\
  \ plastic coating \nwhich had been painted.  The original minimum breaking strength\
  \ of the rope is estimated to \nhave been in the order of 3,500 kg\" (see Appendix\
  \ 1).  \n4.3.4.  A soft eye9 had been formed at each end of the wire rop e using\
  \ a single wire grip10.  At the \nforward end of the wire rope the soft eye had\
  \ been formed through the eye of a bottle -screw or \nturnbuckle , which was in\
  \ turn hooked over the eye bolt (see Figure 5).  \n4.3.5.  There was no record on\
  \ board the Madinah  to show when  the wire had been  fitted.  The wire \nwas not\
  \ entered into the planned maintenance system or wire rope register.  Therefore\
  \ there \nwas no record of it ever having been examined, maintained or tested. \
  \ \n                                                        \n9 A soft eye is a\
  \ loop of rope formed in the  end of a wire or rope usually by splicing or mechanical\
  \ crimp.  A \nsoft eye does not have a thimble or other insert to keep the eye open\
  \ . \n10 A wire grip is a tool that grips two parts of a wire together using a 'U'\
  \ shaped bolt and a saddle.  It is a \nsimple and fast way of making a thimble eye\
  \ or loop termination in wire rope . \n \nFinal report MO -2015 -202 \n<< Page 11\
  \ >>\n 4.3.6.  The point where the wire failed was severely corroded. The re were\
  \ holes in the plastic \nsheathing in the area of the failure (see Appendix 1).\
  \  This had allowed water to penetrate \nthrough the sheathing and corrosion to\
  \ form.  \n \nFigure 5 \nPort accommodation ladder and pipe showing the wire that\
  \ failed  \n(a pipe suspension saddle is a support for a pipe)  \n4.3.7.  An expert\
  \ on ropes, chains and fittings11 stated that best practice was not to use plasti\
  \ c-\ncovered wire rope when wire grips were  to be used.  It further stated that\
  \ to attain an 80% of \nrope minimum breaking load for an eight -millimetre -diameter\
  \ wire rope , a minimum of three  \nwire grips should be used.  The method used\
  \ for forming the eyes at e ach end of the wire rope \ndid not therefore comply\
  \ with industry best practice.  Even though the eyes were not the part \nof the\
  \ wire that failed, this lack of best practice was of concern.  \n4.3.8.  It is\
  \ about as likely as not that the wire rope was originally intend ed to be used\
  \ as a safety \nlifeline.  There was no other logical reason for it being  fitted.\
  \  If this was the case a safety \nlifeline, which is critical equipment, should\
  \  have  been constructed to industry best practice \nand regularly maintained.\
  \ The complete assembly, including the attachment points , should \nhave been  assessed\
  \ for adequate strength and made up of permanent components.  The use \nof an open\
  \ hook on the bottle screw12 was another potential point of failure.  \n4.3.9. \
  \ The use of plastic -coated wire for any rigging that is required to be inspected\
  \  frequently  is \nunsafe.  The Commission has raised this issue in another report\
  \ involving the failure of a \nplastic -coated wire sling used for launching and\
  \ retrieving a lifeboat (MO -2014 -202 Lifting \nsling failure on f reefall lifeboat,\
  \ general cargo ship Da Dan Xia , Wellington, 14 April 2014).  \n              \

  12 A bottle screw is a device for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables,\
  \ tie rods and other tensioning \nsystems. It normally consists of two thr eaded\
  \ eye bolts, one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, \none with a left\
  \ -hand thread and the other with a right -hand thread. The tension can be adjusted\
  \ by rotating \nthe frame , causing both eye bolts to be screwed in or out simultaneously\

  \  Encasing steel wire in plastic sheathing when it is to be used in the marine\
  \ environment has \nsignificant implications for maritime safety, especially when\
  \ the wire must be regular ly \ninspected and maintained in order to remain fit\
  \ for purpose.  \n \nFigure 6 \nPort accommodati on ladder showing wire formation\

  \ that failed  \n \nFinal report MO -2015 -202 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.3.11.  Arising\
  \ from that report the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New\
  \ \nZealand submit the report to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and\
  \ raise the \nimplications that plastic -sheathed wire ropes have for maritime safety\
  \ through th e appropriate \nIMO safety committee for its consideration (recommendation\
  \ 002/15).  Maritime New Zealand \naccepted the recommendation and submitted the\
  \ report to the Ship Systems and Equipment \nsubcommittee of the IMO on 16 March\
  \ 2016 as document SSE.3/INF.4.   This document was \nconsidered and noted by the\
  \ subcommittee and the information will be available for future \nreference.   \n\
  4.3.12.  This report will also be submitted to the IMO Casualty and Statistics working\
  \ group as further \nevidence of the need for action to add ress the safety issue\
  \ of plastic -coated wires in the \nmaritime environment.  \n4.4.  Procedures  \n\
  4.4.1.  At the time of the accident there was no dedicated procedure for rigging\
  \ an accommodation \nladder on board the ship.  As part of its international safety\
  \ management syste m the company \nhad procedures in place for personnel working\
  \ aloft and over the side of the vessel.  The \nprocedure required a risk assessment\
  \ to be made before a permit to work could be issued \nand the work be undertaken\
  \ (see Appendix 3).   \n4.4.2.  However, this pro cedure would normally have been\
  \  used for special or one -off tasks.  It would \nhave been highly unusual for\
  \ a safety management system to require a permit for a routine \ntask of rigging\
  \ a n accommodation ladder , particularly whe n a permanent procedure could \neasily\
  \ be introduced.  \n4.4.3.  When the crew were interviewed  it was apparent that\
  \ there was a normally  followed practice \nof using safety harnesses and buoyanc\
  \ y vests while rigging the accommodation ladder .  \nHowever, there were some variances\
  \ in the methods used th at created some risk as described \nin the following paragraphs.\
  \   \n4.4.4.  At each end of the accommodation ladder a gantline13 had been attached\
  \ to a dedicated \nstrong point , which allowed the crew rigging the accommodation\
  \ ladder a certain amount of \nfree movement al ong the length of the ladder when\
  \ their safety harnesses were attached to it.  \nThe vessel had also been supplied\
  \ with two fall -arrester devices , which could be attached to \ndedicated strong\
  \ points on the vessel to further assist the crew when rigging the \naccommodation\
  \ ladder.   For the most part the crew used this satisfactory arrangement  but \n\
  occasionally they connected their safety harnesses directly to the ship's handrail\
  \ s instead.  \n4.4.5.  It is an unsafe practice to use a vessel's handrail s as\
  \ an anchor point for safety harnesses , \nbecause the material condition and strength\
  \ of the rails are unknown.  They are often only \nlightly welded and would not\
  \ provide sufficient guaranteed strength to withstand the load of a \nfalling person.\
  \  \n4.4.6.  The bosun did not use either of thes e arrangements when he went over\
  \  the side onto the \naccommodation ladder.  Instead he clip ped his safety harness\
  \ onto the wire that had been \nstrung between two eyebolts fitted to the pipe -axle14.\
  \   \n4.4.7.  Crew members who usually rigged the accommodation ladder wer e aware\
  \ of the wire rope \nbetween the eye  bolts , but did not use it as they considered\
  \ it unsafe  due to its appearance . \n4.4.8.  A proper risk assessment for rigging\
  \ a n accommodation ladder  would have identified the \nnecessary  strong point\
  \ s to which to  attach the fall arresters .  Once these strong points had \nbeen\
  \ included in a procedure  any other practice,  including clipping on to the handrail\
  \ s and any \nuse of the wire that failed would have been a departure from the standard\
  \ procedure.   \n                                                        \n13 A\
  \ gan tline is a rope of approximately 20 millimetres in diameter that used to be\
  \ used for hauling sailors \nand tools aloft.  It has sufficient strength to support\
  \ someone should they fall.  \n14 A pipe -axle is an axle that is constructed of\
  \ a certain -diameter hollow  pipe that in this case joins the \nlowering arm and\
  \ upper platform together so that they rotate in unison.   \n \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n\
  \ Final report MO -2015 -202 4.4.9.  Having rules, r egulations and guidelines does\
  \ not in itself ensure compliance, nor does simply \nrepeating the rules and regulations\
  \ in on -board documentation.  The responsibility for \nensuring compliance with\
  \ legislation and company operating procedures rests firstly with the \nship owner\
  \ or operating company, then with senior staff on board who have the responsibility\
  \ \nfor ensuring crew compliance .  It is this chain of responsibility that is espoused\
  \ in the \nInternational Safety Management  Code, and if the chain is broken in\
  \ s ome way the crew who \nare most likely to encounter a local hazard or threat\
  \ are at higher risk of having an accident.  \n4.4.10.  In this case  the vessel's\
  \ managing  company  had not conducted a  risk assessment and had \nnot developed\
  \ a formal procedure for rigging any of the four accommodation ladder s on board\
  \ \nthe Madinah , and n either had the senior on -board management or  the crew\
  \ who were \nperforming the task.  Having a standard procedure for rigging a n accommodation\
  \ ladder  while \nthe shi p was at sea might not have necessarily prevented this\
  \ accident, for the reason given \nabove.  However, by not having one there was\
  \ a heightened risk of such an accident  occurring . \n4.5. Search and rescue  \n\
  4.5.1.  Losing someone overboard  from  a ship is a long -recognised and well documented\
  \ risk \nassociated with any maritime activity.  IMO and the International Chamber\
  \ of Shipping \nprovide d standard procedures to ensure the best and consistent\
  \ method of responding to a \nperson lost overboard.  These procedures were incorporat\
  \ ed in the Madinah 's safety \nmanagement system, but the crew did not follow \
  \ all of  them.  It is difficult to say whether the \nbosun could have been saved\
  \ if the correct procedures had been followed.  Regardless of that \nquestion, it\
  \ is a key lesson for mariner s that man -overboa rd procedures ought to be well\
  \ \npracti sed and followed because in other circumstances they could make  the\
  \ difference \nbetween life and death.  \n4.5.2.  The IMO International Convention\
  \ on  Standards for Training, Certification and Watchkeeping , \n1995 revision ,\
  \ required that seafarers be provided with \"familiarization training \" and \"\
  basic \nsafety training \" as shown below  \nSection A -VI/1  \nMandatory minimum\
  \ requirements for safety familiarization, basic training and \ninstruction for\
  \ all seafarers.  \nSafe ty familiarization training : \n1 Before being assigned\
  \ to shipboard duties, all persons employed or engaged \non a seagoing ship, other\
  \ than passengers, shall receive approved \nfamiliarization training in personal\
  \ survival techniques or receive sufficient \ninforma tion and instruction, taking\
  \ account of the guidance given in part B, \nto be able to:  \n1 communicate with\
  \ other persons on board on elementary safety \nmatters and understand safety information\
  \ symbols, signs and \nalarm signals;  \n2 know what to do if:  \na person falls\
  \  overboard,  \u2026 \n4.5.3.  The vessel's manager  had a man-overboard procedure\
  \ as part of its safety management \nsystem ( see Appendix 2) , which gave  clear\
  \ instructions on the procedure to be follow ed in the \nevent of a man overboard.\
  \  The procedure paraphrase d the details outlined in the \nInternational Chamber\
  \ of Shipping's  Bridge Procedures Guide, Part C Emergency Checklists , \nC4 man\
  \ overboard  (see Appendix 5).    \n4.5.4.  The International Convention for the\
  \ Safety of Life at Sea  requires crews of vessels to conduct \nFire, Abandon Ship\
  \ and other emergency drills at regular intervals.  The most recent  man -\noverboard\
  \ drill on board the Madinah  had been  held on 20 May 2015 (about six weeks before\
  \ \nthis accident) and prior to that on 17 February 2015.   \n4.5.5.  The proper\
  \  man -overboard procedures outlined in the appendices  to this report are based\
  \ on \nthe premise of immediate , intuitive  actions to: raise the alarm ; record\
  \ the position of the \nevent ; return the ship to the scene as soon as possible;\
  \ and render assistance.  \n \nFinal report MO -2015 -202 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.5.6.\
  \  The immediate and intuitive actions for a man -overboard scenario ( see Appendix\
  \ 5) would be \nto: commence a recovery manoeuvre (see Figure 8); note the ship's\
  \ position; release a \nlifebuoy with a light and smoke signal; sound the appropriate\
  \ sound signal on the vessel's \nwhistle; sound the general alarm; and post lookouts\
  \ with binoculars to maintain a continuous \nwatch on the man overboard.   \n4.5.7.\
  \  The actions of  the Madinah 's bridge team were not intuitive .  They did not\
  \ : note the ship's \nposition; release a lifebuoy wit h a light and smoke signal;\
  \ sound the appropriate signal on the \nship's whistle; or sound the general alarm.\
  \  Instead of immediately manoeuvring the vessel to \nreturn to the man -overboard\
  \ position the master asked the pilot on the pilot boat whether he \nshoul d start\
  \ a Williamson turn.  At this point the Madinah  was still close to the man -overboard\
  \ \nposition and had sufficient room and depth of water to return to the man -overboard\
  \ position \nrelatively quickly.  \n4.5.8.  Acknowledging that the Madinah  was\
  \ at that moment pro ceeding to the pilot station and co -\nordinating with the\
  \ pilot for boarding, once the man overboard occurred this should have \ntaken precedence\
  \ and the focus of the master and crew should have turned to responding \nimmediately\
  \ to the emergency.   \n4.5.9.  Had the Madinah  transmitted a distress call on\
  \ the international distress and calling VHF \nfrequency, channel 16, it would have\
  \ alerted all the vessels and radio stations in the vicinity, \nincluding the pilot\
  \ vessel, of the need for assistance and provided the neces sary positional \ninformation.\
  \  \n4.5.10.  In this case the most effective means of raising the alarm on board\
  \ the ship, sounding the \ngeneral alarm, was not used.  Consequently,  not all\
  \ of the crew were available to help manage \nthe recovery.  Instead of broadcasting\
  \ th e alarm externally over the dedicated emergency \ndistress radio channel, the\
  \ master was engaging directly with the pilot vessel.  Eventually the \nsituation\
  \ was escalated to involve all of the available external resources.  However, time\
  \ was \nlost. \n4.5.11.  The positio n where the bosun went overboard was not well\
  \ marked or recorded.  \nConsequently,  the searching vessels had difficulty locating\
  \ the correct search area.  Again, \npotentially valuable time was lost.  \n4.5.12.\
  \  In such cases it is good seafaring practice for the ship to return immediately\
  \ to the position of \nthe man  overboard.  The ship has the means to do so, has\
  \ the best information, and has the \nhigh search platform better suited to searching\
  \ for small people in the water.  \n4.5.13.  This accident highlights the importance\
  \ of havin g an effective emergency response checklist \nto prompt the correct procedure\
  \ s to follow in a high -workload situation, and the efficacy of \nusing the checklist.\
