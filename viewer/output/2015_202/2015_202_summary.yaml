- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The bosun's decision to proceed with rigging the handrails without waiting for the deck trainee and not wearing the buoyancy vest can be considered a human error ("It is unclear why the bosun walked out onto the accommodation ladder without waiting for the deck trainee to return with his buoyancy vest" (4.2.5)). This error increased the risk and contributed to the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the crew were trained and aware of the need for personal protective equipment, there was a lack of a consistent procedure for rigging an accommodation ladder, which suggests a gap in training or competency in this specific task ("The lack of a consistent procedure for rigging an accommodation ladder while still at sea" (4.1.3)).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The bosun's familiarity with the equipment may have been a factor, as he chose to clip his safety harness onto a wire that was not fit for purpose, despite other safer options being available ("The bosun did not use either of these arrangements when he went over the side onto the accommodation ladder" (4.4.6)).
- name: Crew Resource Management

    '
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The bosun did not adhere to safety procedures by not wearing a buoyancy vest and by attempting to rig the handrails alone, which is usually a two-man operation ("Rigging the handrails was usually a two-man operation" (4.2.4), "The bosun was not wearing a buoyancy vest when he fell into the water" (5.1)).
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The lack of a formal procedure for rigging the accommodation ladder and the absence of a risk assessment for this task indicate issues with the organizational safety culture ("At the time of the accident there was no dedicated procedure for rigging an accommodation ladder on board the ship" (4.4.1)).
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The failure to identify the wire as a risk and the lack of maintenance records for the wire rope suggest inadequate risk management and analysis ("There was no record on board the Madinah to show when the wire had been fitted" (4.3.5), "The point where the wire failed was severely corroded" (4.3.6)).
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: 'The use of the wire rope and the lack of a formal procedure may indicate issues with regulatory oversight and compliance, but there is no direct mention of specific regulatory failures contributing to the accident.

- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The wire rope's failure due to corrosion, which went undetected due to the plastic coating, indicates a failure in maintenance and inspection regimes ("The wire rope parted because it was significantly weakened by corrosion" (5.3)).
