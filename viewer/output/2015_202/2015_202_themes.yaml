- name: Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
  explanation: The use of appropriate personal protective equipment is a critical safety theme in this accident. The bosun was not wearing a buoyancy vest when he fell into the water, which "would have significantly enhanced his chances of surviving after falling overboard" (5.1). Additionally, both the bosun and the deck trainee were wearing safety harnesses, indicating an awareness of the need for correct PPE (4.2.1). However, the bosun attempted to rig the handrails without waiting for the deck trainee to return with the buoyancy vests (4.2.3), which was a deviation from the usual safety practices and contributed to the severity of the accident.
- name: Adequacy of Safety Equipment and Procedures
  explanation: The adequacy of safety equipment and procedures is another safety theme related to this accident. The wire rope to which the bosun attached his safety harness was not fit for purpose, as it broke when he fell, leading to his fall into the sea (5.2). The wire rope was significantly weakened by corrosion, which went undetected due to the plastic coating, preventing proper inspection and maintenance (5.3). Furthermore, there was no formal procedure on board to guide the crew in proper safety precautions for rigging the accommodation ladder (5.4), indicating a lack of consistent safety procedures.
- name: Inspection and Maintenance of Safety Equipment
  explanation: Inspection and maintenance of safety equipment is a crucial safety theme in this incident. The wire rope's failure was due to severe corrosion, which was not detected because of the plastic sheathing (4.3.6). The wire was not entered into the planned maintenance system or wire rope register, and there was no record of it ever having been examined, maintained, or tested (4.3.5). This lack of inspection and maintenance of critical safety equipment directly contributed to the accident.
- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  explanation: Risk assessment and management is a safety theme that is highlighted by this accident. The non-wearing of a personal flotation device by the bosun appeared to be an exceptional violation, which indicates a failure in risk assessment and management (4.2.7). A proper risk assessment for rigging an accommodation ladder would have identified the necessary strong points for attaching fall arresters, and a procedure would have prevented the use of unsafe practices (4.4.8). The absence of a risk assessment and a formal procedure for rigging the accommodation ladder increased the risk of such an accident occurring (4.4.10).
- name: Emergency Response and Training
  explanation: Emergency response and training is a safety theme that emerged from the accident. The shipboard emergency response did not follow best industry practice, which could have been critical in different circumstances (5.5). The crew did not follow the man-overboard procedures incorporated in the Madinah's safety management system (4.5.1), and the most recent man-overboard drill had been held six weeks prior to the accident (4.5.4). This indicates a potential gap in the effectiveness of emergency response training and the application of procedures during an actual emergency.
- name: Safety Culture and Compliance
  explanation: Safety culture and compliance with established safety procedures is a theme that is evident in this accident. The responsibility for ensuring compliance with legislation and company operating procedures rests with the ship owner or operating company and senior staff on board (4.4.9). In this case, the managing company had not conducted a risk assessment nor developed a formal procedure for rigging the accommodation ladders, and neither had the senior on-board management or the crew performing the task (4.4.10). This indicates a breakdown in the safety culture and compliance with safety procedures, which could lead to accidents.
