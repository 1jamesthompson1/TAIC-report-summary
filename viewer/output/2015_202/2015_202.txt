The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqu iries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 2 July 2015 the container ship Madinah  was preparing for arrival at the port of Lyttelton.  
Part of those preparations involved the bosun  (deck crew foreman)  and a deck trainee rigging 
the port-side accommodation ladder over the ship's side in readiness for the ship 's dock ing. 
1.2. Both the bosun and the deck trainee were wearing safety harnesses.  The bosun sent the deck 
trainee to fetch buoyancy vests, which were required to be worn for any task outside the ship 's 
railing.  When the trainee returned the bosun had already swung the accommodation ladder 
over the side, clipped his s afety harness to a plastic -coated wire and walked along the 
accommodation ladder to try to lift the handrails into place.  
1.3. In doing so the bosun lost his balance and fell into the sea.  The wire to which he had clipped 
his safety harness had broken.   A crew  member on the deck threw a lifebuoy into the water 
near the bosun.  The bosun was last seen swimming towards the lifebuoy.  
1.4. The pilot launch that was heading towards the Madinah  at the time arrived in the area and 
started the search.  Despite an extensive search using several other small craft and a 
helicopter for the next two hours , the bosun was never found.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  that if the bosun had 
been wearing a buoyancy vest his chances of surviving would have been significantly greater .  
It also found that the wire rope to which the bosun had connected his safety harness broke 
because it was severely corroded and also that it had not been  constructed and installed in 
accordance with best industry practice . 
1.6. Two safety issues  identified were : there was no dedicated formal procedure for rigging the 
accommodation  ladders  and gangways on board;  and although the procedures on board for 
responding to a man overboard met industry best practice,  the shipboard  response to the 
emergency did not follow those procedures.  
1.7. A third  safety issue  identified was the use of plastic -coated wire for safety -critical applications.  
If the  plastic co ating becomes damaged , salt water can enter and become entrapped in the 
coati ng, which causes accelerated corrosion.  The plastic coating makes it virtually impossible 
for the wire to be inspected or surveyed  properly .  The Commission has raised this issue in a 
previous inquiry and made recommendations to the Director of Maritime N ew Zealand to 
address the issue . 
1.8. The vessel's manager  has taken safety action to address other safety issues  discussed later in 
the report .  Therefore,  the Commission has not made any new recommendations arising from 
this inquiry.  
1.9. Key lessons  arising from this inquiry included:  
 where it is necessary for a crew member to work over the side of a ship when at sea, they 
must wear a safety harness attached to a designated strong point and must wear a 
buoyancy vest  
 plastic -coated wires must be treated with caution.  Seafarers and surveyors alike must 
not make assumptions about the condition of any wire that they cannot see, especially 
when the wire has a safety -critical purpose and is required by rules, regulations or 
procedures to be examined  thoroughly  
 a man-overboard situation require s timely  and intuitive  actions by the crew in order  for 
the rescue  to be successful.  Crew should follow quick -reference checklists to ensure  
that:  the alarm is raised in the appropriate way; the position of the casualty is re corded 
and tracked; and the ship is returned to the casualty in the most expeditious way

 Final report MO -2015 -202 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 2 July 2015 at around 0700, t he Hong Kong -registered container ship Madinah  arrived off 
the port of Lyttelton on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand  after an overnight 
voyage from Port Chalmers  (Dunedin) .   
3.1.2.  The master was informed that the vessel would not be berthing until early afternoon the same 
day and chose to let t he vessel drift off the port of Lyttelton until the pilot boarding time.  
3.1.3.  The crew were engaged in deck maintenance during the m orning.  At about 1130 the master 
asked  the bosun to rig the port -side combination  pilot ladder2.  The bosun , accompanied by 
two able-bodied seamen , rigged the combination  pilot ladder  and made other preparations for 
the ship's arrival at Lyttelton .  At 1230 the Madinah  began the journey towards the pilot 
station (see Figure 1), the position where the pilot would normally board  the vessel .  The 
master and the second officer  were on the bridge .   
3.1.4.  At the time of the accident  the wind was reported to be north-easterly at approximately 10 
knots3 with a north -easterly swell of about one metre.  The visibility was good and the tide was 
flooding.   
Events on the main deck  
3.1.5.  At about 1300 the master asked for the port accommodation ladder  to be rigged before the 
crew went to their mooring  stations .  The bosun and the deck trainee proceeded  to the port 
accommodation ladder  station .  When they arrived the bosun  told the deck trainee to get two 
buoyancy vests4 from the crew changing room , which was inside the acc ommodation .   
3.1.6.  The deck trainee returned from the changing room wearing his own buoyancy vest and 
carrying one for the bosun .  However, t he bosun had already removed the lashings and 
lowered the accommodation ladder  to below the main deck level.  The deck trainee stood on 
the top platform of the accommodation ladder , from where  he saw that  the bosun had walked 
more than halfway down  it and was crouched  down trying to lift the outboard handrail from its 
stowage position  (see Figure 2) . 
3.1.7.  As the deck trainee  watched , the handrail  snapped back into its stowage position , caus ing the 
bosun to lose his balance  and fall into the sea .  The bosun was wearing a safety harness 
connected to a wire, but a s his body weight came on the safety harness li ne the wire parted 
and the bosun fell into the sea.   
3.1.8.  The deck trainee immediately called the bridge on his very -high-frequency (VHF) portable 
transceiver5 and reported that the bosun had fallen overboard .  He then ran  along the main 
deck towards the stern to locate a lifebuoy.   Meanwhile another crew member who was 
working near the stern of the ship  had heard the commotion and a splash.  He grabbed a 
nearby lifebuoy  and threw it overboard . The bosun was seen trying to swim  an estimated 10 -
15 metres to the lifebuoy . 
                                                        
2 Normally, pilots board and disembark using a traditional rope ladder.  However, if the freeboard of the 
vessel exceeds nine metres, regulations require that the rope ladder be supplemented by an accommodation 
ladder , the lower platform of which is at least five metres above sea level , thereby reducing the distance the 
pilot has to climb . 
3 A knot is one nautical mile per hour . 
4 A buoyancy vest is a personal flotation device that can be worn in conjunction with a person's other safety 
devices and provides a certain amount of buoyancy should the wearer fall into the water.  A buoyancy vest 
does not provide as much buoyancy as a regular lifejacket.   
5 A transceiver is a radio that is capable of both transmitting and receiving calls on certain frequencies .

(starboard accommodation ladder shown)  
 
3.1.9.  Those crew  members in possession of VHF radio s heard the deck trainee' s call and made their 
way to the deck to assist.  The c hief officer made his way to the stern of the ship, where he 
saw the bosun some distance away in the w ater.  He called  the master for instructions  and 
was told to  stand  by at the pilot boarding station .  Some time later the chief mate heard on his 
VHF radio that the Madinah  was proceeding to the man -overboard position to assist in the 
search .  He  made his way to the bow and sent one of the crew to get binoculars from the 
bridge to help look for the bosun.  
Events on the navigating bridge  
3.1.10.  On hearing the VHF radio message from the deck trainee , the master immediately stopped the 
engine and ordered th e helm put hard  to port (the side from which the bosun had fallen).  
Both he and the second officer made their way to the port bridge wing  from where they saw 
the bosun in the water.  The master saw that a lifebuoy  had been thrown towards the bosun , 
so he decided  not to release the man -overboard lifebuoy6 from the port bridge wing.    
3.1.11.  The second officer telephoned the third officer  and asked him  to commence preparing the 
vessel's rescue boat7.  The second officer then  contacted the Lyttelton port control on VHF 
channel 12 and advised them  that they had a man overboard.  The call was answered by one 
                                                        
6 A man -overboard lifebuoy is a dedicated man -overboard lifebuoy that rests in a quick -release cradle (one on 
each navigation bridge wing) and has a smoke signal and a light that both activate when the lifebuoy is 
released.

 Final report MO -2015 -202 of two  pilots who were  on board  the pilot vessel  en-route to meet the ship at the pilot boarding 
ground .  He advised that the pilot vessel  would be there as soon a s possible to assist .  
3.1.12.  At about 1316 the master called the pilot and asked whether he should turn the Madinah  
around and return to the man -overboard position or wait for the pilot vessel.  A pilot on board 
the pilot vessel replied that it was probably best  to wait for the pilot vessel before turning.  At 
that time the pilot vessel was about seven  minutes from the Madinah .   
3.1.13.  At 1336 the pilot vessel requested that  the Madinah  return to the man -overboard position.  
The master turned the vessel around and returned to the general area of the man-overboard 
position.  At about 1342, as  the Madinah  was returning to the man -overboard position, the 
third officer reported that both lifeboats were unlashe d and ready to be lowered.   
3.1.14.  At about 1354 the master ordered a crew muster and head count, after which all available 
crew were distributed around the vessel's decks to assist in searching for the bosun.  Once 
the vessel had returned to the approximate pos ition of the man overboard , the master 
maintained the vessel in this position while the other smaller vessels that had responded to 
the call conducted the search.   
Events on the pilot vessel  
3.1.15.  When the pilot vessel received the call from the Madinah  it was approximately 3.6 nautical 
miles from the ship.  The pilot estimated that it would take them 12 minutes to get to the man -
overboard position.   
3.1.16.  One of the pilots advised port control of the situation and requested that they inform the 
Coastguard  and the 'Westpac rescue ' helicopter and ask other vessels to assist.  Port control 
also informed the Police and the harbour master of the emergency.   
3.1.17.  On the way to the accident site the crew of the pilot vessel were unable to locate the lifebuoy  
or the bosun, so th ey asked the Madinah  to direct them.  The Madinah 's crew had kept the 
lifebuoy and bosun in sight for as long as possible, but by the time they were asked by the 
crew of the pilot vessel for guidance they had lost sight of the bosun and the lifebuoy and we re 
only able to direct the pilot vessel to an approximate area.  At about 1333, about 20 minutes 
after the bosun had been  lost overboard, they found a hard hat and a pair of working gloves 
belonging to him.   
3.1.18.  A pilot requested Lyttelton Harbour Radio to pr ovide  more assistance.  A fishing vessel, two 
port tugs, two coastguard vessels, several workboats from Lyttelton and a fast rescue boat 
from an anchored tanker responded and a grid search was initiated.  The rescue helicopter 
arrived at the scene and star ted to conduct an expanding circle search.  The outbound 
container vessel stopped to the north of the search area and provided a static search platform 
using it s increased height of eye.  
3.1.19.  At about 1449  the control of the search was handed to the New Zealand  Police search and

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction to the issues  
4.1.1.  Preparing an accommodation ladder for use is a routine task carried out many time s a day 
across the world on vessels of all sizes.  It is not unusual for  a crew to prepare t he 
accommodation ladder before a ship arrives at the dock.  This requires them to work outside 
the rail (often referred to as 'over the side ').  Having c rew members work over the side is a risk 
that has been widely recognised by the industry for many decad es. 
4.1.2.  In 2014 the U nited Kingdom  P&I Club8 issued Technical Bulletin Number 42/2014 , which  
stated:  
The UK Club's claims statistics show that many serious injuries (or deaths) are 
caused by falls from gangways  or embarkation ladders. The Club's risk assessors 
frequently visit ships where these are badly rigged, in a poor condition or witness 
dangerous working practices.  Many accidents occur during the rigging of the 
gangway . The process of rigging the stanchio ns and the side ropes is inherently 
dangerous as there can be little for crew members to hold on to until this is 
completed. Crew should always wear a safety harness and lifejacket during this 
operation. Securing of the safety harness line can sometimes be  difficult as there 
can be little to clip on to and movement can be restricted by the length of the 
harness line.  
4.1.3.  The following analysis discusses the circumstances of what happened in this case.  It also 
discusses the following issues:  
 The lack of a consi stent procedure for rigging a n accommodation ladder  while still at sea  
 The design and failure of the wire that the bosun had connected his safety harness to  
 The shipboard emergency response to the bosun falling into the sea  
4.2. What happened  
4.2.1.  When the bosun and  the deck trainee went to prepare the accommodation ladder the bosun 
was aware of the need for the correct personal protective equipment.  Both he and the deck 
trainee were wearing their safety harnesses, and he had sent the deck trainee to retrieve their 
buoyancy vests from the crew changing room.  
4.2.2.  While the deck trainee went to collect the buoyancy vests, the bosun started unlashing the 
accommodation ladder , swinging it out and  lowering it to a level  where the handrails could be 
rigge d.  This part of the o peration could be accomplished safely from the vessel's deck 
because it did not require him to go over the side.  
4.2.3.  However,  he then  walked out onto the accommodation ladder , connected his safety harness 
onto the plastic -coated wire rope and attempt ed to rig the handrail s without waiting for the 
deck trainee to return with the buoyancy vests.  
4.2.4.  Rigging the handrails was usually  a two -man operation.  The handrail s comprise a long 
aluminium pipe supported by pivoting stanchions along its length.  The geometry  of the 
handrail is such that when one end is lifted it tends to cause the other end to "dig in".  Normal 
practice on board was to use two crew members to raise both ends simultaneously.  Lifting the 
hand rail  from  the middle cause s both ends to "dig in" a nd results in the handrail snapping 
back down , in this case with sufficient force to cause the bosun to lose his balance and fall off 
the accommodation ladder.  
4.2.5.  It is unclear  why the bosun walked out onto the accommodation ladder without waiting for the 
deck trainee to return with his buoyanc y vest.  He possibly felt secure in the fact that he was 
                                                        
8 Protection and indemnity insu rance, more commonly known as 'P&I' insurance, is a form of mutual maritime insurance 
provided by a P&I Club.  Whereas a marine insurance  company provides 'hull and machinery ' cover for ship  owners, and 
cargo cover for cargo owners, a P&I Club provides cover for open -ended risks that traditional insurers are reluctant to 
insure  (Anderson, 1999) .

 Final report MO -2015 -202 wearing a safety harness and would not therefore fall into the sea.   However, the wire he 
clipped on  to was not of sufficient strength to arrest his fall.  
4.2.6.  Accordin g to studies of 'human factors' , individual actions can be classified in several ways; in 
1990 James Reason proposed some distinctions that have become widely accepted.  Firstly, 
he made an important distinction between two broad groups of individual actio ns that 
increase risk (Walker, 2004) .   
 Errors : those occasions in which an individual's planned sequence of 
mental or physical activities fails to achieve their intended outcomes, and 
when these failures cannot be attributed to the intervention of some 
chance agency (Reason, 1990) . 
 Violations : deliberate deviations from an organisation's safety procedures 
drawn up for the safe or efficient operation and maintenance of plant or 
equipment (Health and Safety Executive, 1995) . 
4.2.7.  In this case the non -wearing of a personal flotation device appeared to be an exceptional 
violation.  Exceptional violations appear as isolated departures from authority, not necessarily 
indicative of individuals' typical behaviour patterns or condoned by management (Reason, 
1990) .  They are not considered exceptional because of their extreme nature; rather they are 
considered exceptional because they are neither typical of the individuals nor condoned by 
authority.  What makes exceptional violations particularly difficult for an o rganisation to deal 
with is that they are not indicative of individuals' behavioural repertoire and, as such, are 
particularly difficult to predict.  Usually when individuals are confronted with evidence of their 
behaviour and asked to explain it, they are  left with little explanation (Shappell & Wiegmann, 
2000) . 
4.3. Failure of the wire to arrest the bosun's fall  
4.3.1.  The wire to which  the bosun attached his safety harness was plastic coated.  It was rigged 
between two eye  bolts that ha d been fitted to the accommodation ladder suspension 
arrangement (see Figures 4 and 5).   
4.3.2.  There was no record on board the Madinah  of when and who  had fitted the eye  bolts.  Each of 
the four accommodation ladders (one either side of the accommodation and on e either side at 
the pilot boarding station on the main deck) fitted on the Madinah  had been similarly 
modified.  However , only the port -side accommodation ladder had a wire strung between the 
eye bolts.  
4.3.3.  This wire was removed from the vessel after the acci dent and sent for examination and testing 
by an independent contractor engaged by the Commission.  The independent contractor 
reported that the "wire rope was a 6 x 19 right hand regular lay galvanised steel wire rope with 
fibre core of approximately 8 mm diameter. The rope was sheathed with a plastic coating 
which had been painted.  The original minimum breaking strength of the rope is estimated to 
have been in the order of 3,500 kg" (see Appendix 1).  
4.3.4.  A soft eye9 had been formed at each end of the wire rop e using a single wire grip10.  At the 
forward end of the wire rope the soft eye had been formed through the eye of a bottle -screw or 
turnbuckle , which was in turn hooked over the eye bolt (see Figure 5).  
4.3.5.  There was no record on board the Madinah  to show when  the wire had been  fitted.  The wire 
was not entered into the planned maintenance system or wire rope register.  Therefore there 
was no record of it ever having been examined, maintained or tested.  
                                                        
9 A soft eye is a loop of rope formed in the  end of a wire or rope usually by splicing or mechanical crimp.  A 
soft eye does not have a thimble or other insert to keep the eye open . 
10 A wire grip is a tool that grips two parts of a wire together using a 'U' shaped bolt and a saddle.  It is a 
simple and fast way of making a thimble eye or loop termination in wire rope . 
 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.3.6.  The point where the wire failed was severely corroded. The re were holes in the plastic 
sheathing in the area of the failure (see Appendix 1).  This had allowed water to penetrate 
through the sheathing and corrosion to form.  
 
Figure 5 
Port accommodation ladder and pipe showing the wire that failed  
(a pipe suspension saddle is a support for a pipe)  
4.3.7.  An expert on ropes, chains and fittings11 stated that best practice was not to use plasti c-
covered wire rope when wire grips were  to be used.  It further stated that to attain an 80% of 
rope minimum breaking load for an eight -millimetre -diameter wire rope , a minimum of three  
wire grips should be used.  The method used for forming the eyes at e ach end of the wire rope 
did not therefore comply with industry best practice.  Even though the eyes were not the part 
of the wire that failed, this lack of best practice was of concern.  
4.3.8.  It is about as likely as not that the wire rope was originally intend ed to be used as a safety 
lifeline.  There was no other logical reason for it being  fitted.  If this was the case a safety 
lifeline, which is critical equipment, should  have  been constructed to industry best practice 
and regularly maintained. The complete assembly, including the attachment points , should 
have been  assessed for adequate strength and made up of permanent components.  The use 
of an open hook on the bottle screw12 was another potential point of failure.  
4.3.9.  The use of plastic -coated wire for any rigging that is required to be inspected  frequently  is 
unsafe.  The Commission has raised this issue in another report involving the failure of a 
plastic -coated wire sling used for launching and retrieving a lifeboat (MO -2014 -202 Lifting 
sling failure on f reefall lifeboat, general cargo ship Da Dan Xia , Wellington, 14 April 2014).

12 A bottle screw is a device for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods and other tensioning 
systems. It normally consists of two thr eaded eye bolts, one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, 
one with a left -hand thread and the other with a right -hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating 
the frame , causing both eye bolts to be screwed in or out simultaneously .

 Final report MO -2015 -202 4.3.10.  Encasing steel wire in plastic sheathing when it is to be used in the marine environment has 
significant implications for maritime safety, especially when the wire must be regular ly 
inspected and maintained in order to remain fit for purpose.

 4.3.11.  Arising from that report the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand submit the report to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and raise the 
implications that plastic -sheathed wire ropes have for maritime safety through th e appropriate 
IMO safety committee for its consideration (recommendation 002/15).  Maritime New Zealand 
accepted the recommendation and submitted the report to the Ship Systems and Equipment 
subcommittee of the IMO on 16 March 2016 as document SSE.3/INF.4.   This document was 
considered and noted by the subcommittee and the information will be available for future 
reference.   
4.3.12.  This report will also be submitted to the IMO Casualty and Statistics working group as further 
evidence of the need for action to add ress the safety issue of plastic -coated wires in the 
maritime environment.  
4.4.  Procedures  
4.4.1.  At the time of the accident there was no dedicated procedure for rigging an accommodation 
ladder on board the ship.  As part of its international safety management syste m the company 
had procedures in place for personnel working aloft and over the side of the vessel.  The 
procedure required a risk assessment to be made before a permit to work could be issued 
and the work be undertaken (see Appendix 3).   
4.4.2.  However, this pro cedure would normally have been  used for special or one -off tasks.  It would 
have been highly unusual for a safety management system to require a permit for a routine 
task of rigging a n accommodation ladder , particularly whe n a permanent procedure could 
easily be introduced.  
4.4.3.  When the crew were interviewed  it was apparent that there was a normally  followed practice 
of using safety harnesses and buoyanc y vests while rigging the accommodation ladder .  
However, there were some variances in the methods used th at created some risk as described 
in the following paragraphs.   
4.4.4.  At each end of the accommodation ladder a gantline13 had been attached to a dedicated 
strong point , which allowed the crew rigging the accommodation ladder a certain amount of 
free movement al ong the length of the ladder when their safety harnesses were attached to it.  
The vessel had also been supplied with two fall -arrester devices , which could be attached to 
dedicated strong points on the vessel to further assist the crew when rigging the 
accommodation ladder.   For the most part the crew used this satisfactory arrangement  but 
occasionally they connected their safety harnesses directly to the ship's handrail s instead.  
4.4.5.  It is an unsafe practice to use a vessel's handrail s as an anchor point for safety harnesses , 
because the material condition and strength of the rails are unknown.  They are often only 
lightly welded and would not provide sufficient guaranteed strength to withstand the load of a 
falling person.  
4.4.6.  The bosun did not use either of thes e arrangements when he went over  the side onto the 
accommodation ladder.  Instead he clip ped his safety harness onto the wire that had been 
strung between two eyebolts fitted to the pipe -axle14.   
4.4.7.  Crew members who usually rigged the accommodation ladder wer e aware of the wire rope 
between the eye  bolts , but did not use it as they considered it unsafe  due to its appearance . 
4.4.8.  A proper risk assessment for rigging a n accommodation ladder  would have identified the 
necessary  strong point s to which to  attach the fall arresters .  Once these strong points had 
been included in a procedure  any other practice,  including clipping on to the handrail s and any 
use of the wire that failed would have been a departure from the standard procedure.

and tools aloft.  It has sufficient strength to support someone should they fall.  
14 A pipe -axle is an axle that is constructed of a certain -diameter hollow  pipe that in this case joins the 
lowering arm and upper platform together so that they rotate in unison.

 Final report MO -2015 -202 4.4.9.  Having rules, r egulations and guidelines does not in itself ensure compliance, nor does simply 
repeating the rules and regulations in on -board documentation.  The responsibility for 
ensuring compliance with legislation and company operating procedures rests firstly with the 
ship owner or operating company, then with senior staff on board who have the responsibility 
for ensuring crew compliance .  It is this chain of responsibility that is espoused in the 
International Safety Management  Code, and if the chain is broken in s ome way the crew who 
are most likely to encounter a local hazard or threat are at higher risk of having an accident.  
4.4.10.  In this case  the vessel's managing  company  had not conducted a  risk assessment and had 
not developed a formal procedure for rigging any of the four accommodation ladder s on board 
the Madinah , and n either had the senior on -board management or  the crew who were 
performing the task.  Having a standard procedure for rigging a n accommodation ladder  while 
the shi p was at sea might not have necessarily prevented this accident, for the reason given 
above.  However, by not having one there was a heightened risk of such an accident  occurring . 
4.5. Search and rescue  
4.5.1.  Losing someone overboard  from  a ship is a long -recognised and well documented risk 
associated with any maritime activity.  IMO and the International Chamber of Shipping 
provide d standard procedures to ensure the best and consistent method of responding to a 
person lost overboard.  These procedures were incorporat ed in the Madinah 's safety 
management system, but the crew did not follow  all of  them.  It is difficult to say whether the 
bosun could have been saved if the correct procedures had been followed.  Regardless of that 
question, it is a key lesson for mariner s that man -overboa rd procedures ought to be well 
practi sed and followed because in other circumstances they could make  the difference 
between life and death.  
4.5.2.  The IMO International Convention on  Standards for Training, Certification and Watchkeeping , 
1995 revision , required that seafarers be provided with "familiarization training " and "basic 
safety training " as shown below  
Section A -VI/1  
Mandatory minimum requirements for safety familiarization, basic training and 
instruction for all seafarers.  
Safe ty familiarization training : 
1 Before being assigned to shipboard duties, all persons employed or engaged 
on a seagoing ship, other than passengers, shall receive approved 
familiarization training in personal survival techniques or receive sufficient 
informa tion and instruction, taking account of the guidance given in part B, 
to be able to:  
1 communicate with other persons on board on elementary safety 
matters and understand safety information symbols, signs and 
alarm signals;  
2 know what to do if:  
a person falls  overboard,  … 
4.5.3.  The vessel's manager  had a man-overboard procedure as part of its safety management 
system ( see Appendix 2) , which gave  clear instructions on the procedure to be follow ed in the 
event of a man overboard.  The procedure paraphrase d the details outlined in the 
International Chamber of Shipping's  Bridge Procedures Guide, Part C Emergency Checklists , 
C4 man overboard  (see Appendix 5).    
4.5.4.  The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea  requires crews of vessels to conduct 
Fire, Abandon Ship and other emergency drills at regular intervals.  The most recent  man -
overboard drill on board the Madinah  had been  held on 20 May 2015 (about six weeks before 
this accident) and prior to that on 17 February 2015.   
4.5.5.  The proper  man -overboard procedures outlined in the appendices  to this report are based on 
the premise of immediate , intuitive  actions to: raise the alarm ; record the position of the 
event ; return the ship to the scene as soon as possible; and render assistance.  
 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.5.6.  The immediate and intuitive actions for a man -overboard scenario ( see Appendix 5) would be 
to: commence a recovery manoeuvre (see Figure 8); note the ship's position; release a 
lifebuoy with a light and smoke signal; sound the appropriate sound signal on the vessel's 
whistle; sound the general alarm; and post lookouts with binoculars to maintain a continuous 
watch on the man overboard.   
4.5.7.  The actions of  the Madinah 's bridge team were not intuitive .  They did not : note the ship's 
position; release a lifebuoy wit h a light and smoke signal; sound the appropriate signal on the 
ship's whistle; or sound the general alarm.  Instead of immediately manoeuvring the vessel to 
return to the man -overboard position the master asked the pilot on the pilot boat whether he 
shoul d start a Williamson turn.  At this point the Madinah  was still close to the man -overboard 
position and had sufficient room and depth of water to return to the man -overboard position 
relatively quickly.  
4.5.8.  Acknowledging that the Madinah  was at that moment pro ceeding to the pilot station and co -
ordinating with the pilot for boarding, once the man overboard occurred this should have 
taken precedence and the focus of the master and crew should have turned to responding 
immediately to the emergency.   
4.5.9.  Had the Madinah  transmitted a distress call on the international distress and calling VHF 
frequency, channel 16, it would have alerted all the vessels and radio stations in the vicinity, 
including the pilot vessel, of the need for assistance and provided the neces sary positional 
information.  
4.5.10.  In this case the most effective means of raising the alarm on board the ship, sounding the 
general alarm, was not used.  Consequently,  not all of the crew were available to help manage 
the recovery.  Instead of broadcasting th e alarm externally over the dedicated emergency 
distress radio channel, the master was engaging directly with the pilot vessel.  Eventually the 
situation was escalated to involve all of the available external resources.  However, time was 
lost. 
4.5.11.  The positio n where the bosun went overboard was not well marked or recorded.  
Consequently,  the searching vessels had difficulty locating the correct search area.  Again, 
potentially valuable time was lost.  
4.5.12.  In such cases it is good seafaring practice for the ship to return immediately to the position of 
the man  overboard.  The ship has the means to do so, has the best information, and has the 
high search platform better suited to searching for small people in the water.  
4.5.13.  This accident highlights the importance of havin g an effective emergency response checklist 
to prompt the correct procedure s to follow in a high -workload situation, and the efficacy of 
using the checklist.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The bosun was not wearing a buoyancy vest when he fell into the water.  A buoyancy vest 
would have significantly enhanced his chances of surviving after falling overboard . 
5.2. The bosun fell into the sea because the wire rope to which he had connected his safety 
harness broke when he lost his balance and fell.  The design of the wire rope and its method 
of attachment to the ship were  not fit for the purpose of attaching a safety  harness.  
5.3. The wire rope parted because it was significantly weakened by corrosion .  The corrosion had 
gone undetected because the wire was coated in plastic, a significant safety issue that 
prevented the wire rope being properly inspected and maintained.  
5.4. There was sufficient personal safety equipment provided on board the Madinah  for safely 
rigging the accommodation ladder  while at sea  in good weather conditions.  However, there 
was no formal procedure on board to guide the crew in the proper safety precaut ions to take.  
5.5. The shipboard emergency response to the bosun falling overboard did not  follow best industry 
practice, which would have been  unlikely to alter the outcome in this case.  However, in 
different circumstances, such as if the bosun had been weari ng a buoyancy vest, any delay in 
retrieving someone from the water can prove fatal.

 Final report MO -2015 -202 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identifie d 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Since the accident  the vessel's manager , Seaspan Ship Management  Ltd., has: 
 compiled a document on the p rocedure for safe rigging of gangways /accommodation 
ladders , which has been distributed fleet -wide  (see Appendix 4)  
 carried out a c lose inspection of all wires associated with gangways  and 
accommodation ladder wires , fleet -wide  
 retrofitted  gangways  and accommodation ladders with new wires and ancillary 
equipment  where deemed necessary , fleet -wide  
 compiled and instituted d etailed inspection routines for gangways  and 
accommodation ladders , which have been included in the planned maintenance 
system fleet -wide  
 compiled i nternal audit checklists for superintendents an d the Health, Safety, 
Environment and Quality  team for stan ding wires and associated equipment , for use 
throughout the fleet .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it con siders the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector  
7.2. The safety actions taken by Seaspan Ship Management Ltd ha ve negated the need for 
recommendations to be made.   
  
 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report MO -2015 -202 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Where it is necessary for a crew member to work over the side of a ship when at sea, they 
must wear a safety harness attached to a designated strong point and must wear a buoyancy 
vest.  
8.2. Plastic-coated wires must be treated with caution.  Seafarers and surveyors alike must not 
make assumptions about the condition of any wire that they cannot see, especially when the 
wire has a safety -critical purpose and is required by rules, regulations or pr ocedures to be 
examined  thoroughly . 
8.3. A man-overboard situation require s a high number of actions by a number of crew over a s hort 
period of time in order to be successful.  Crew should follow quick -reference checklists to 
ensure  that:  the alarm is raised in  the appropriate way; the position of the casualty is recorded 
and tracked; and the ship is returned to the casualty in the most expeditious way

 Final report MO -2015 -202 Appendix 1 : Report on status of failed wire  
 
Introduction  
1 Following an accident that occurred on board M.V. Madinah  on 2nd July 2015, DTA was requested 
to investigate the cause of failure of a safety wire which had failed during the incident when a 
crew member fell overboard.  
2 The failed wire was received on 23rd July 2015.  
Examination  
3 The wire received consisted of a 6 x 19 r ight hand regular lay galvanised steel wire rope with fibre 
core. The rope was sheathed with a plastic coating which had been painted. Eye ends for 
attachment had been formed by loops fastened with clips/clamps. Wire rope diameter was 
measured to be approx imately 8 mm. Failure had occurred approximately mid span. Figure 1 
shows the failed ends of the rope upon receipt.  
4 The failed zone was clearly severely corroded. The outer plastic sheathing appeared to be 
relatively  degraded, possibly with crimping or ab rasion damage. An area of fresh abrasions was 
also present and it  has been assumed that this fresh damage had occurred during the accident 
(figure 2). At approximately 60  - 70 mm from one side of the failure, surface penetrations were 
present (figure 3).   
5 On the other half of the rope multiple cracks of the sheathing were present from the failure  
extending to approximately 300 mm from the failure (figure 4.) Beneath these sheathing cracks 
the wire  rope was superficially bright and shiny, but with evidence o f corrosion emanating from 
the core.   
6 In order to assess the general condition of the wire rope, an area was randomly selected  
approximately 900 mm from the failure. The outer sheathing was removed and the strands and 
wires  separated for examination. As can be seen in figure 5, no corrosion had occurred, and the 
sheathing was  intact and pliable.

7 All of the wires at the point of failure were corroded to the extent that none of the zinc coating 
remained. A great number of the wires were severely corroded to the point that individual wire 
strength would have been negligible. This was evidenced by extreme thinning of the wires as 
shown in figures 6 and 7.

Discussion  
8 In very general terms, the condition of the wire rope beneath the  plastic sheathing was found to 
be very good. The sheathing was also in good condition with good ductility remaining. At a few 
points, however, the sheathing had been compromised and corrosion had occurred. In addition to 
the zone of failure, at each end o f the rope the sheathing had been cut (necessarily so) and 
where the eye ends had been attached to end fittings and clamps, the sheathing had been 
penetrated, allowing corrosion to occur.  
9 In order to partially assess the corrosion implications, the number  of wires that had corroded to 
negligible strength at the failure was counted. Note that in order to preserve the general condition 
of the rope at this location for future reference, this was not done rigorously. The results, 
therefore, should be considere d to provide a conservative estimate of the residual strength prior 
to failure. Of the 114 individual wires, at least 77 were counted as being severely corroded. The 
original minimum breaking strength of the rope is estimated to have been in the order of 3 ,500 
kg [A, B]. Based on the wire count, the residual strength, therefore, would have been 
approximately 32% of original, or 1,120 kg. It is important to note that the residual strength 
would have been less than this, because ALL wires had been corroded to  some degree.  
10 The reason for severe corrosion at the particular point of failure is not clear. There is some 
evidence of long term sheathing degradation at this location, but the cause of it is not obvious. lt 
is possible that the rope passed through a re tention eye or stanchion at this point, or that it had 
been damaged at some time previously by crushing, crimping or cutting. The source of this 
damage should be investigated.

 Conclusions  
11 Failure of the safety wire occurred when a crew member harnessed  to the wire fell overboard. The 
wire is likely to have been severely corroded to the extent that it was unable to withstand the 
force of the falling crew member.  
12 There is evidence to suggest that the sheathing at the point of failure had been penetrated 
allowing corrosion to occur prior to the accident.  
Recommendations  
13 It is recommended  that the cause of sheathing failure at the location of the rope failure be 
determined.

Revision:  1 
Valid from:    01/05/2014  
Doc No.:  SP-102 
WORKING ALOFT -OVERSIDE PERMIT  
 
Purpose  
 To provide guidance in preparing for and carrying out Risk Assessment and obtaining permits 
to work Working Aloft/Overside.  
 This applies to all vessels.  
 
Definition  
'Working aloft' involves performing activities at heights 2 m and above in areas that are considered unsafe. 
Unsafe means any area or platform that is not surrounded by rails on three sides, where the rails are:  
 Minimum 1.2 m in height  
 Divided vertically by a bar and small rails approximately 60 cm high in between  
 
'Overside' means outside the ship's rails.  
Responsibility  
Master  
 Ensure that all requirements for working aloft operations are strictly followed.  
 Ensure that work ove rside is avoided while the vessel is underway.  
 
Personnel involved in working aloft or overside have the following responsibilities  
Personnel Not to Perform Work  
Personnel who have a fear of heights should not perform this work. Personnel under 18 years o f age, or 
with less than 12 months of experience at sea, should not work aloft or overside unless accompanied by 
an experienced seafarer or otherwise adequately supervised.  
Permit to Work and Risk Assessment  
Before any work aloft or overside starts, the fo llowing must be done:  
 A Working Aloft / Overside Work Permit  must be completed and approved along with a 
Risk Assessment  
 All personnel involved in the task must participate in an on -site review of the Working Aloft 
/ Overside Work Permit   
 
Safety Equipment  
When working aloft or overside, use a harness, fall arrestor and lifeline, and adjust the line length to avoid 
unnecessary slack. Safety belts are not approved equipment.  
When using staging at the hull side, make sure that the two gantlines used  in its rigging are long enough 
to at least trail into the water to provide additional lifelines in case a crew member falls in.

WORKING ALOFT -OVERSIDE PERMIT  
 
When working overside, always use a personal flotation device such as a working vest or lifejacket.  
When there is a risk of a person falling into the water, a ladder should be lowered to the water to aid in 
recovery, and a lifebuoy with a line should be standing by for rapid deployment at the work site.  
Preparing the Work Site and Equipment  
Prepare the site and equipment as follows:  
 Store equipment for working aloft away from heat and sunlight, separated from containers of 
chemicals, detergents, rust removers, paint strippers or other substances capable of 
damaging them. Clearly mark staging equipment to prevent their use for purposes other than 
working aloft.  
 Use polypropylene ropes with ultraviolet protection for gantlines, safety lines and the rope in 
the bosun chair. Make sure that splices have at least three full tucks.  
 When using a bosun chair for riding topping lifts or stays, make sure that the bow of the 
shackle, not the pin, rides on the wire. The pin should be moused.  
 Check that the securing points for lines and blocks are of adequate strength and, where 
practicable, are permanent fixtures to the ship's structure.  
 Do not place tools where they may be accidentally knocked down and fall on someone below. 
Do not carry tools in pockets from which they may easily fall.  
 Switch off radar and transmission devices if working near a relevant mast.  
 Rope off with warning signs the area directly below the work site. Secure doors leading into 
roped -off areas.  
 Do not use Jacob's ladders to read drafts. If req uired for a critical transit or operation and no 
other options are available, they may only be used after a thorough Risk Assessment , 
including completion of a Working Aloft / Overside Work Permit  
 Get approval from the duty deck officer:  
o Before starting th e operation  
o When it is dark and adequate lighting needs to be coordinated  
 
Accommodation Ladder  
Only rig the accommodation ladder after considering all of the following basic safety measures:  
 Determine if the task can be performed without going overboard —for example, the rigging of 
handrail lines so that handrails can be raised or lowered from the safety of the main deck if 
possible.  
 Attach a safety line to a strong point on deck and safety harness on the individual.  
 Position a lifebuoy with line for immediate use.  
 Have a crew member on constant standby on deck, in touch with the bridge via walkie -talkie 
and available to throw the lifebuoy if required.  
 The Officer of the Watch is familiar with the correct response when a person falls overboard

ladder s/accommodation ladders  
Procedure For Safe Rigging of Gangways /Accommodation Ladders  
The following procedure for safe rigging of gangways /accommodation ladders is to be followed on all 
Company ships.  
Step -1: 
Risk Assessment - A detailed risk assessment shall be carried out and discussed by the Chief Officer 
with relevant crew and officers, at least once prior commencement of coastal voyages between ports 
and more frequently if necessary.  The risk analysis shall be reviewed each time for any changes to 
physical conditions of work, equipment or personnel. See attached example of such a risk assessment.  
 
Risk assessment discussed by Chief Officer with the crew.

 Final report MO -2015 -202  
Step -2: 
Preparation for wo rk overside  - Crew members involved in working overside shall prepare themselves 
with the correct safety gear. This shall include boiler suits, safety shoes, safety helmets, leather gloves, 
flotation device and safety harness. A lifebuoy with a buoyant lin e must be kept standing by. The Chief 
Officer shall issue a Working Aloft -Overside Work Permit FM -112 when he is satisfied that all 
requirements are met.  
 
Wear the flotation device and pull each of the straps until they are fully tight. Tuck in loose ends.  
 
Wear the safety harness and ensure that the thigh straps are properly tightened.  
 
Tighten the chest straps and check that the safety harness lanyard & hook are free.  
  

 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 35 >>
  
Step -3: 
Tool -Box Meeting  - A tool -box meeting shall be held prior to commencement of the job. This is to be a 
brief meeting in which the person in charge (normally the Chief Officer or the Bosun), will explain who 
will be responsible for what job and how it is to be done. Any doubts or que ries must be clarified 
before the job is commenced.  
 
Team leader directs each crew member to perform particular tasks.  
Step -4: 
Cross -Check Equipment  - A cross -check of the safety equipment worn is to be carried out so as to  
ensure that each person has wo rn the safety harness and the flotation device correctly and that there  
are no visible defects.  
 
Check the straps at the back and the front. The safety harness should be comfortably tight.  

 

<< Page 36 >>
 Final report MO -2015 -202  
Make adjustments to the flotation device straps. Check that the lanyard & hook are in good condition.  
Step -5: 
Unlashing The Accommodation  ladder  - All the lashings of the accommodation  ladder  are to be 
removed systematically and cleared.  
 
 
Step -6: 
Once all the lashings are off and securing bolts clear of the accommodation  ladder , positive reporting 
to the accommodation  ladder  operator is to be carried out. This can be a simple hand signal.  
 
Crew report back positively that all lashings are clear. Team Leader acknowledges the report.  
Step -7: 

 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 37 >>
 Swinging out the accommodation  ladder  - Check that there are no obstructions overside. The team 
leader will swing  out the accommodation  ladder  in a controlled manner until it is parallel to the main 
deck.  
 
Step -8: 
Securing the Fall Arrestor  - Two crew members will secure the fall arrestor to the standing wire, one  
near the top of the accommodation  ladder  and one between the bottom platform and swinging arm. 
Before stepping  overside on the accommodation  ladder , they shall secure their safety harness lanyard 
hook to the fall  arrestors.  
 
 
Step -9: 
Rigging the top platform stanchions  - The crew member working near the top platform of the 
accommodation  ladder  will insert all stanchions in place.  
  

 

<< Page 38 >>
 Final report MO -2015 -202  
Step -10: 
Rigging the collapsible railings  - The operator shall lower the accommodation  ladder  by about 2 
meters. Both crew  members working overside shall rig the accommodation  ladder  railings, first 
inboard side and then the outboard side.  
 
Step -11: 
Securing the railings & rope work  - One of the overside crew must connect the upper part of the  
collapsible railings to the top stanchions and lash the safety ropes tightly while the other overside crew  
member shall connect the bottom end stanchions to the other end of the collapsible railings.  
 
  

 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 39 >>
 Step -12: 
Completion of rigging accommodation  ladder  - After completion of rigging the accommodation  ladder , 
the two overside crew will  return on board for mooring stations. Bosun shall confirm to bridge on a 
walkie -talkie that the accommodati on ladder  has been rigged and all personnel are safely back on 
board.  
 
Step -13: 
Lowering the accommodation  ladder  to quay level  - After the vessel is safely moored alongside the 
berth, one of the  crew wearing a flotation device and safety harness shall proceed to the bottom of 
the accommodation  ladder  to direct  the accommodation  ladder  operator while he is lowering the 
accommodation  ladder . Using hand signals, he will guide the operator  until the b ase of the 
accommodation  ladder  is close to the quay level and then signal him to stop lowering . 
 
Crew member directs operator to lower accommodation  ladder . Once close to the quay level he 
signals him to stop.  
Step -14: 

 

<< Page 40 >>
 Final report MO -2015 -202 Rigging the inboard side of the accommodation  ladder  net - Other crew on deck shall tie the inboard 
side of the  accommodation  ladder  net to the ship's railings.  
 
Step -15: 
Placing the accommodation  ladder  base on the quay  - Two crew members shall assist the man at the 
bottom of the  accommodation  ladder  to push the accommodation  ladder  away from ship's side so that 
he may step safely on the quay. Once he is  on the quay, he shall pull the manrope secured at the 
bottom of the accommodation  ladder  so that two more crew  can step ashore to  assist him to pull the 
accommodation  ladder  onto the quay. The accommodation  ladder  operator must pay close  attention 
to them while lowering the accommodation  ladder , waiting for it to clear the edge as the crew pull out 
the accommodation  ladder  and then lowering it on to the quay.  
 
  

 
Final report MO -2015 -202 
<< Page 41 >>
 Step -16: 
Rigging the outboard side of the accommodation  ladder  net - One of the crew will pull the 
accommodation  ladder  net from the  shipside towards the quay using a long -handled hook. He will 
make sure to stay clear of the edge of the  quay. Another crew member shall hold on to his safety 
harness line as an additional precaution. Other  crew will make fast the outboard side of the net to the 
outboard side of the accommodation  ladder  railings such that,  should anyo ne fall between the 
accommodation  ladder  and the shipside, that person will be caught in the net.  
 
Step -17: 
Completing the job  - Ensure that the accommodation  ladder  net extends at least four meters past the 
bottom of the  accommodation  ladder  platform so that no person falls in the water in case he trips at 
the base of the accommodation  ladder . After  completing this job, the Bosun shall inform the duty 
officer that the accommodation  ladder  is ready. Duty Officer shall  check that the accommodat ion 
ladder , accommodation  ladder  net, safety notices and sufficient illumination are correctly in place  
using the checklist CL -003 - Access -Accommodation Ladder -Gangway  Checklist. Once he has 
confirmed  that everything on this checklist has been completed, he will sign it and then present it to 
the Master for  his signature. Master will visually confirm that the means of access to the vessel is safe 
for use before  signing the checklist.  
 
 
Refer to the following documentation in the DocMap system SMS which pr ovides additional guidance;  
SP-105: Safe access to and from vessel  
SP-102: Working aloft -overside permit  
Some ports in the world (eg. USA/Canada/Australia) may require the net to be rigged differently. You  
must comply with port regulations but follow the s afe working practices shown above.
