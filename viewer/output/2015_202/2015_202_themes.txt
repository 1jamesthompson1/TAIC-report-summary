Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of consistent procedure for rigging an accommodation ladder while at sea.
- The report highlights the absence of a dedicated procedure for rigging the ladder, leading to variances in methods used and increased risk.
- The lack of a standard procedure heightened the risk of accidents occurring.

2. Failure of the wire to arrest the bosun's fall.
- The wire rope used to attach the safety harness was not of sufficient strength and broke, causing the bosun to fall.
- The wire rope had severe corrosion, which weakened it and allowed water to penetrate through the sheathing.

3. Inadequate search and rescue procedures.
- The crew did not follow proper man-overboard procedures, such as noting the ship's position, releasing a lifebuoy, sounding appropriate signals, and sounding the general alarm.
- The position where the bosun went overboard was not well marked or recorded, causing difficulty in locating the correct search area.
