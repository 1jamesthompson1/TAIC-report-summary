Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of consistent procedure for rigging an accommodation ladder while at sea: The report highlights the absence of a dedicated procedure for rigging the accommodation ladder on board the ship, which increases the risk of accidents.
2. Failure of the wire to arrest the bosun's fall: The wire rope to which the bosun attached his safety harness was not of sufficient strength and had severe corrosion, leading to its failure and the bosun falling into the sea.
3. Inadequate search and rescue procedures: The crew did not follow proper man-overboard procedures, including raising the alarm, recording the position, and returning the ship to the scene immediately. This resulted in delays and difficulties in locating the bosun, highlighting the importance of effective emergency response protocols.
