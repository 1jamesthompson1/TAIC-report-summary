","0.0","10.0","The master's decision to proceed across the Bar could be considered a human error or assumption, as it was made with the wave conditions appearing to be acceptable, but without full awareness of the actual conditions that were about to deteriorate (4.7, 4.11). However, the document does not explicitly attribute the accident to human error or assumptions, so the percentage is relatively low.
","0.0","0.0","There is no information provided in the document that suggests a lack of training or competency contributed to the accident, so the percentage is zero.

","0.0","5.0","The ship was crossing the Bar right on the limit of maximum safe operating conditions, which suggests a possible lack of adherence to safety procedures given the forecasted deterioration of conditions (4.10). However, the document does not strongly emphasize this as a contributing factor, so the percentage is low.
","0.0","1.667","The Ports of Auckland had a safety management system and an agreement on maximum observed wave height restrictions, indicating some level of safety culture (4.6). However, the decision to cross despite the forecast may reflect on the organizational safety culture, so a small percentage is attributed here.
","2.887","20.0","The risk assessment by Ports of Auckland and the agreement on wave height restrictions indicate that risk management and analysis were in place (4.6). However, the decision to proceed with the crossing despite the forecasted conditions suggests a failure in applying this analysis effectively, making it a significant contributing factor.
","0.0","0.0","There is no indication that a lack of regulatory oversight and compliance contributed to the accident, so the percentage is zero.
","0.0","16.667","The master and bridge crew believed the wave conditions were acceptable for crossing, which suggests a lapse in situational awareness given the actual conditions and forecasts (4.7, 4.8). This is a significant contributing factor as it directly affected the decision to proceed with the crossing.

The master's decision to cross the Bar despite the forecasted significant wave height and the observed conditions at the time of crossing were critical in the outcome (4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.11).
