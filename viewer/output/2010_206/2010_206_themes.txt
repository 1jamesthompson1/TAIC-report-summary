Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Challenges of navigating over a Bar: The presence of a Bar across the entrance to a harbor creates additional risks for shipping due to changing channels, unpredictable and treacherous wave conditions, and limitations on the type and size of ships that can enter the harbor.

2. Risk assessment and decision-making: The report highlights the importance of conducting a risk assessment and making informed decisions based on available information. The master's decision to proceed across the Bar, despite marginal wave conditions, contributed to the accident.

3. Lack of information and monitoring: The report mentions the absence of a wave-rider buoy near the Manukau Bar and the difficulty in maintaining navigation buoys and beacons in the area. The lack of real-time data and monitoring systems affected the ability to accurately assess wave conditions and warn the ship's crew.
