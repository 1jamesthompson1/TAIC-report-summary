  \ to a harbour creates special challenges and \nadditional risks for shipping in\
  \ comparison with more  conventional harbours.  A Bar usually \nforms  when  debris\
  \ carried by rivers and strong tidal flows is deposited where the waterway \nmeets\
  \ the sea , thus forming an area of shallower water with deeper , more navigable\
  \ channels \nscoured by the current .  The position of these channels  is nearly\
  \ always changing in respon se \nto floods, strong  tides and severe  sea conditions\
  \ outside the Bar.   \n4.2. The wave conditions over a Bar can be unpredictable\
  \ and treacherous.  When surface waves \nmove towards shallow water they slow down,\
  \ their wave height increases and the distance \nbetween waves decreases.  This\
  \ behaviour is called shoaling.   The waves may or may not build \nto the point\
  \ where they break, depending on how large th ey were to begin with and how steep\
  \ \nthe slope of the Bar is.  For this reason, n avigating over a Bar requires extreme\
  \ caution.  \n4.3. The existence of a Bar limits the type and size of ship that\
  \ can enter the harbour.  Ships must \nbe relatively shallow in draught  to avoid\
  \ grounding.  They also need  sufficient propulsion  to \ndrive through shoaling\
  \ waves.  A  ship's ability to cross a Bar safely  is a fine balance between \n\
  the size and nature of the waves  over the Bar and not driving the ship so hard\
  \ as to cause it \ndamag e. \n4.4. It is not always possible  to utilise the available\
  \ propulsion power when a ship is pitching into \nwaves  because the  ship's p itching\
  \ motion  into waves causes the propeller to lose immersion.  \nIn extreme cases\
  \ the propeller can momentarily lift clear of the water altogether.  Because the\
  \ \nship must have a  relatively shallow draught  to begin with (due to the shallow\
  \ water over the \nBar) this makes maintaining propeller immersion more difficult.\
  \  \n4.5. The size of the waves passing over the Bar is ther efore t he critical\
  \ factor.  The larger  the \nwaves, the more likely they are to be breaking  and\
  \ the more difficult it will be for the ship to \nmaintain  sufficient propeller\
  \ immersion to use its available engine power to keep  its speed \nwhilst crossing\
  \  the Bar. \n4.6. Ports of Auckland had conducted a risk assessment when developing\
  \ its safety management \nsystem12.  The risk assessment confirmed past practice\
  \ that had considered any waves more \nthan four metres over the Bar to be unsafe\
  \ for the typical size of ships  operating into Manukau \nHarbour.  The port company\
  \ had therefore developed an agreement  that set a four-metre \nmaximum observed\
  \ wave height restriction on ships crossing the Manukau Bar.  The forecast \nfor\
  \ the Raglan marine forecast area was for a significan t13 wave height  to build\
  \ to four metres \non the Friday evening before the accident , then build further\
  \ to six metres during the day of \nthe accident.  Even a four -metre swell, combined\
  \ with wind -generated waves and the shoaling \neffect over the Manukau Bar, would\
  \ produc e waves well in excess of the four -metre limit.  \n4.7. However, the Raglan\
  \ marine forecast area spanned Cape Egmont  in the south up to Manukau \nHarbour\
  \ in the north.  The weather pattern was building from the southwest, which meant\
  \ the \nconditions over th e Manukau Bar could have reasonably been  expected to\
  \ build during the \nlatter part of the forecast period.  This was consistent with\
  \ what the signalman at the South \nHead signal s tation observed at first light\
  \ when the Spirit of Resolution  was en route  from \nOnehunga to the Manukau Bar,\
  \ namely  observed waves of 3.5 to four metres .  Also, when the \nSpirit of Resolution\
  \  arrived at the entrance to Manukau Harbour, to the master and the other \nbridge\
  \ crew the wave conditions looked to be acceptable for making  the crossing.  \n\
  4.8. The fact that the Spirit of Resolution  had almost completed the Bar crossing\
  \ uneventfully \nbefore encountering the first of a series of larger wave s support\
  \ s the master's decision.  The \nfact that the wave conditions continued to deteriorate\
  \ fr om that point on suggests there was \n                                    \
  \                    \n12 A system recommended and approved by Maritime New Zealand\
  \ in accordance with the New Zealand  Port \nand Harbour Marine Safety Code 2004\
  \ (to promote good practice in the conduct of safe marine operations in \nports\
  \ and harbours)  \n13 Significant wave height is defined as the average height of\
  \ the highest one -third of waves.  \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report MO -2010 -206\
  \ an element of bad luck with the timing of the crossing and the onset of the swell\
  \ generated by \nthe approaching weather system.   That aside, the ship was crossing\
  \ the Bar right on the limit \nof maximum  safe operating condi tions , which were\
  \ forecast to deteriorate .  There was \ntherefore a high risk  of the ship becoming\
  \ overwhelmed by the sea conditions during  the \nestimated 30 minutes it would\
  \ normally take to clear the Bar. \n4.9. Once the ship was caught on the Bar in\
  \ deteriorating  wave conditions , it was captured  in that \nfine balance between\
  \ having or applying  sufficient power to clear the Bar or sustaining \ndamage to\
  \ the ship and cargo.  Unable to make any headway against the shoaling waves , and\
  \ \nunable to turn around , the ship was carried  by the south -flowing set out\
  \ of the main channel \ninto shallower water , where  its rudder  struck the seabed\
  \ . \n4.10.  Once the ship had lost its rudder, it was extraordinary  that it was\
  \ able to make it clear  of the \nBar into deeper waters.  S hips that have  their\
  \ accommodation block near the ir stern s tend to \npoint  into the wind  when moving\
  \ forward , which during  this period  was blowing on-shore, from  \nthe direction\
  \ of deep water.   This was likely to have been the main factor contributing to\
  \ the \nship clearing the Bar, aided by the master's use of the bow  thruster. \
  \ \n4.11.  A major factor contributing to the accident was the master's decision\
  \ to proceed across the \nBar.  A point to consider is whether his decision would\
  \ have been different if more information \nhad been  availabl e to him on the actual\
  \ wave conditions over and outside the Bar. \n4.12.  Ports of Auckland has not attempted\
  \ to install a wave -rider buoy near the Manukau Bar.  O ne \nreason for that is\
  \ the difficulty  it has had in maintaining navigation buoys and beacons in the\
  \ \narea.  A navigation buoy located on Huia Bank inside of the Bar has succumbed\
  \ to the \nextreme tides and weather.  Two attempts were made at replacing the buoy\
  \ with a pile \nbeacon, but those also succumbed to the tides and weather.  \n4.13.\
  \  Since this accident the operator  has ceased operating into Manukau Harbour and\
  \ the one \nother regular shipping service operating into Onehunga is likely to\
  \ cease operating there within \nthe next one or two years.  \n4.14.  Mathemati\
  \ cal wave modelling and weather forecasting can provide a reasonably accurate \n\
  warning of weather conditions.  In this example t he actual weather conditions for\
  \ the Raglan \nmarine forecasting area closely resembled what was forecast.  \n\
  4.15.  The signalman often use d the wave -rider buoy off Taharoa as an indication\
  \ of when conditions \nwere  likely to begin affecting the Manukau Bar.  For weather\
  \ systems approaching from the \nsouth he generally used a three -hour rule of thumb\
  \ for when conditions at Taharoa would be \nexperie nced at the Manukau Bar.  Data\
  \ from the Taharoa wave -rider  buoy  before it stopped \nrecording showed that\
  \ the significant wave height was trending up and had reached five \nmetres by 2100\
  \ on the day before the accident.  Even though the real -time data was not \navailable\
  \ at the time the Spirit of Resolution  was approaching the Bar, this information\
  \ , \ntogether with the weather forecast , should have been enough to warn the signalman\
  \ and the \nmaster that the re was a high likelihood  of the average wave conditions\
  \ over the Bar exceed ing \nthe maximum permissible.    \n4.16.  The issues with\
  \ the Taharoa wave-rider buoy have since been resolved.  The Commission is \nnot\
  \ of a mind to recommend installing more technology to measure sea conditions off\
  \ \nManukau Harbour unless  there is a significant increase in shipping activity\
  \ in the harbour  to \njustify the expenditure, especially as in this case there\
  \ was sufficient information available for \nthe master to make an informed decision\
  \ .  This is however an issue that the Auckland \nTransport Harbourmaster  will\
  \ need to monitor in future  as shipping trends may change and \nother cost -effective\
  \ technology may develop . \n \nFinal report MO -2010 -206 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 5.\
  \ Findings  \n5.1. The Spirit of Resolution  grounded on the Manukau Bar when it\
  \ was overwhelmed by wave \nconditions and was carried out of the main channel into\
  \ shallow water under the influence of \ntidal and current flows.  \n5.2. The actual\
  \ wave conditions over the Manukau Bar were observed by both the master and the\
  \ \nsignal station operator to be marginally within the maximum permissible parameters\
  \ just prior \nto the Spirit of Resolution  beginning the Bar crossing.  However,\
  \ there was sufficient \ninformation in the wave forecast and information from the\
  \ Taharoa wave -rider buoy to assess \nthat there was a high risk of enco untering\
  \ wave conditions beyond the maximum permitted \ncriteria in the 30 minutes it would\
  \ normally take to cross the Bar. \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>"
