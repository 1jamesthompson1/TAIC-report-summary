Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Lack of situational awareness: Both the bridge team on board the Rose Harmony and the watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo had low situational awareness of other marine traffic in the vicinity. This was due to factors such as distraction, improper use of radar equipment, and failure to plot the track of the other vessel.

2. Poor bridge resource management: The situational awareness of the bridge team on the Rose Harmony was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters.

3. Inadequate training: The deckhand keeping watch on board the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to be left in sole charge of the watch. The training system for deckhands in watchkeeping practices was not consistent with the requirements of Maritime Rules, leading to a lack of understanding of the risks and proper actions to be taken.

4. Failure to follow collision-prevention rules: The collision between the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo occurred because neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules. Both vessels were power-driven vessels in a head-on situation that required each to alter its course to starboard.

5. Distraction and presence of non-essential personnel: The presence of passengers on the bridge of the Rose Harmony and the distraction caused by their presence affected the bridge team's ability to manage the conduct of the vessel effectively. This highlights the importance of controlling access to the bridge to prevent distractions.

6. Inadequate use of radar equipment: Both vessels failed to properly use radar equipment, including long-range scanning, to obtain early warning of the risk of collision. This contributed to the low situational awareness and failure to detect the other vessel in a timely manner.
