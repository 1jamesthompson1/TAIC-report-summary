- name: Bridge Resource Management
  explanation: Bridge Resource Management (BRM) is the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Rose Harmony, poor BRM was identified as a significant factor contributing to the collision. The situational awareness of the bridge team was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters (3.11). Additionally, the report highlights the importance of good communication and coordinated actions as part of effective BRM, which was lacking during the emergency situation (3.18, 3.19).
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and accurately anticipating potential future events. In this accident, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo suffered from low situational awareness. The Rose Harmony's bridge team had low situational awareness of other marine traffic, which was a contributing factor to the collision (4.3). Similarly, the sole watchkeeper on the Leila Jo had low situational awareness as to the risk of collision with the Rose Harmony because the radar equipment was not used to plot the track of the Rose Harmony (4.5).
- name: Adherence to Collision Regulations
  explanation: Adherence to collision regulations is crucial for the prevention of accidents at sea. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) provide rules to be followed to prevent collisions. In this incident, neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules, which directly led to the collision (4.1). Both vessels were required to alter course to starboard to pass on the port side of each other, which did not occur (4.2).
- name: Use of Radar Equipment
  explanation: Proper use of radar equipment is essential for early detection of potential collisions and for maintaining situational awareness. In the case of the Rose Harmony, the radars were set on short range for the entire pilotage, which likely delayed the detection of the Leila Jo (3.13). The crew's improper use of radar equipment and the absence of long-range scanning were significant factors contributing to the low situational awareness (4.4).
- name: Training and Familiarity with Safety Regulations
  explanation: Adequate training and familiarity with safety regulations are fundamental for ensuring that crew members can effectively perform their duties. The deckhand on the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to be left in sole charge of the watch, which was a safety issue contributing to the accident (3.25, 3.27, 3.37). The report also notes that the training system in place was not consistent with the requirements of Maritime Rules Part 31, which requires owners, skippers, and watchkeepers to take account of the standards of STCW-F (3.38).
- name: Distraction by Non-Essential Personnel
  explanation: The presence of non-essential personnel on the bridge can be a significant source of distraction for the bridge team, affecting their ability to manage the vessel's conduct effectively. During the pilotage of the Rose Harmony, the presence of passengers on the bridge was problematic and affected the bridge team's performance at a critical time (3.21, 3.23). The report cites previous incidents where distraction by passengers on the bridge led to adverse outcomes, emphasizing the relevance of this safety theme to the accident (3.24).
