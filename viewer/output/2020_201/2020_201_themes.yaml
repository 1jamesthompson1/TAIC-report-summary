- name: Bridge Resource Management
  explanation: 'Bridge Resource Management (BRM) refers to the effective management and utilization of all resources, human and technical, available to the bridge team to ensure the safe navigation of the vessel. In the case of the Rose Harmony, poor BRM was identified as a significant factor contributing to the collision. The situational awareness of the bridge team was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, which was exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters ("safety issue: the situational awareness of the bridge team on the rose harmony was adversely affected by poor bridge resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting influence of passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters" (3.10)). This indicates that the bridge team was not effectively managing the available resources, including the radar equipment and personnel, to maintain situational awareness and prevent the collision.'
- name: Situational Awareness
  explanation: Situational awareness involves understanding the current environment and being able to project future status. In this incident, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo suffered from low situational awareness. The Rose Harmony's bridge team had low situational awareness of other marine traffic, which was a significant factor in the collision ("The bridge team on board the Rose Harmony, both during the pilotage and immediately after the pilotage ended, had low situational awareness of other marine traffic in the vicinity" (4.3)). Similarly, the watchkeeper on the Leila Jo did not use radar equipment to plot the track of the Rose Harmony, which had been detected ahead, indicating a lack of situational awareness as to the risk of collision ("The sole watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo had low situational awareness as to the risk of collision with the Rose Harmony because the radar equipment was not used to plot the track of the Rose Harmony" (4.5)). This theme is relevant because it directly impacted the ability of both vessels to detect and respond to the risk of collision.
- name: Adherence to Collision Regulations
  explanation: Adherence to collision regulations, specifically the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), is crucial for the safe navigation of vessels and the prevention of accidents. In this accident, neither vessel's crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules, which led to the collision ("The collision between the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo occurred because neither of the vessels' crew took the correct action in accordance with the collision-prevention rules" (4.1)). Both vessels were required to alter their course to starboard to pass on the port side of each other, which did not happen ("With reference to the collision-prevention rules, both the Rose Harmony and the Leila Jo were power-driven vessels in a head-on situation that required each to alter its course to starboard so that each passed the other on its port side" (4.2)). This theme is relevant as the failure to follow these regulations was a direct cause of the collision.
- name: Distraction on the Bridge
  explanation: Distraction on the bridge can significantly impair the bridge team's ability to maintain situational awareness and respond to hazards. In the case of the Rose Harmony, the presence of passengers on the bridge was identified as a contributing factor to the collision due to the distraction they caused ("Distraction due to passengers being on the Rose Harmony bridge, the crew improperly using radar equipment, and the absence of long-range scanning to obtain an early warning of the risk of collision, were significant factors contributing to the bridge team's low situational awareness" (4.4)). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of minimizing non-essential activities and personnel on the bridge during critical navigation periods to prevent accidents.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Safety Regulations
  explanation: Proper training and familiarity with safety regulations, such as the COLREGs, are essential for all crew members responsible for navigational watchkeeping. The watchkeeper on the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to undertake a sole watch, which was a safety issue contributing to the accident ("The watchkeeper on board the Leila Jo was not sufficiently familiar with the collision-prevention rules to undertake a sole watch" (4.6)). This theme is relevant as it underscores the need for adequate training and understanding of safety regulations to ensure that crew members can effectively identify and respond to risks.
- name: Effective Communication and Challenge in Hierarchical Structures
  explanation: Effective communication and the ability to challenge decisions within hierarchical structures are critical for safety, especially in emergency situations. In this incident, the third officer on the Rose Harmony did not escalate their communication to challenge the master's decisions effectively, which could have prevented the collision ("One technique to overcome a power-distance relationship is the use of graded assertiveness communication. Communication escalates from probing to alerting to challenging, and eventually to emergency. The third officer was heard probing and alerting the master to the situation on the voyage data recorder's audio recording, but did not take it to the next level of challenge or emergency" (3.20)). This theme is relevant because it demonstrates the importance of assertive communication in safety-critical environments, where hesitation or deference can lead to accidents.
