  \ minor damage and injuries resulting fro m this accident, \ncollisions between\
  \ large vessel s and smaller fishing vessels can be catastrophic . \nWorldwide over\
  \ many years t here have been many fatalities resulting from such \ncollisions .\
  \ The Transport Acc ident Investigation Commission (Commission)  has \ninvestigated\
  \ one such case, a  collision in 1996 between the container vessel  Sydney \nExpress\
  \  and the fishing vessel  Maria Luisa  at the entrance to Wellington Harbour. \
  \ \n3.2. The Sydney Express  was outbound from Wellington and the Maria Luisa  was\
  \ inbound  \nwhen the two vessels collided , with a loss of five lives14. \nThe\
  \ collision regulations  \n3.3. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions\
  \ at Sea , known as the COLREG s, \nwere introduced by the International Maritime\
  \ Organi zation  in 1972. The COLREG s set \nout, among other things, the ' rules\
  \ of the road ' or navigation rules to be followed by \nvessel s and other vessels\
  \ at sea to prevent collisions between two or more vessels . The \nCOLREGs are derived\
  \ from a  multilateral treaty  called the  Convention on the \nInternational Regulations\
  \ for Preventing Collisions at Sea . \n3.4. The COLREG s have been given effect\
  \  in New Zealand through Maritime Rules Part 22 : \nCollision Prevention . \n3.5.\
  \ This collision occurred in open waters  where no other special rules appl ied.\
  \ Fishing \nvessels that are engaged in fishing have special considerations under\
  \ Maritime Rules \nPart 2 2. However, t he Leila Jo  was not engaged in fishing\
  \ . Therefore, both the Rose \nHarmony  and the Leila Jo  were defined as power\
  \ -driven vessels under way. Neither  had \nright of way over the other based on\
  \ size or manoeuvrability  alone . \n3.6. The COLREG s required b oth vessels to\
  \ \" use all available means appropriate to the \nprevailing circumstances and conditions\
  \ to determine if the risk of collision exists. If \nthere is any doubt, such risk\
  \ must be considered to exist \"15. \n3.7. The COLREG s also required that, for\
  \ both vessels , \"proper use must be made of radar \nequipment, if fitted and operational,\
  \ including long -range scanning to obtain early \nwarning of the risk of collision\
  \ and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects \"\
  \n16. \n3.8. The Leila Jo  and the Rose Harmony  were in what is described in COLREG\
  \ s Rule 14  as a \n\"head -on situation \"17, and because they were two power -driven\
  \ vessels meeting on \nreciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve\
  \ a risk of collision, each had to  \n \n \n14 Transport Accident Investigation\

  \  and the fishing trawler Maria Luisa, Wellington Heads, 29 December 1996.  \n\
  15 Maritime Rules Part 22.7(1).  \n16 Maritime Rules Part 22.7(2).  \n17 Such a\
  \ situation will be considered to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly\
  \ ahead and by night, \nthe masthead  lights of the  other vessel are in line or\
  \ nearly in line and/or both sidelights are visible (Maritime \nRules Part 22.14.2(a)).\

  \ so that each passe d on the port side of the other18 (see \nFigure 9 ). \n \n\
  Figure 9: COLREG s Rule 14: Head -on situation  \n(Credit : West of England Protection\
  \ and Indemnity provider ) \n3.9. The meeting of these two vessels was not a complex\
  \ situation. Each vessel w as \nequipped with appropriate radar equipment capable\
  \ of  detecting  the other  and there \nwas ample sea room for each to manoeuvre\
  \ as  required by the rules . \n \n \n18 Maritime Rules Part 22.14(1).  \n\n \n\
  Final Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 3.10. If the collision regulations\
  \  had been followed, each  would have detected the other  in \nsufficient time\
  \ to have  recognised that a risk of collision was developing or existed and  \n\
  altered their course to starboard early enough to pass safely on each other's port\
  \ side. \nThe following analysis considers why the crew of each vessel did not take\
  \ appropriate \naction.  \nThe Rose Harmony  \nSafety issue : The situational awareness\
  \ of the bridge team on the Rose Harmony was adversely \naffected by poor bridge\
  \ resource management, exacerbated by the presence and distracting \ninfluence of\
  \ passengers on the bridge in pilotage waters . \n3.11. The fundamental aspects\
  \ of watchkeeping  - position monitorin g, collision avoidance  \nand maintaining\
  \ situational awareness - apply as much  to vessels under pilotage as \nthey do\
  \ to  keeping watch on a coastal route. Situational awareness is more than just\
  \ \nknowing where a  vessel  is. It involves the entire bridge team (crew and pilot)\
  \ working \ntogether to ensure all are aware of all factors that are affecting the\
  \ vessel  or are likely \nto affect it in the immediate future, including the presence\
  \ of other traffic.  \n3.12. The bridge team in this case appear ed to have been\
  \ caught up in the ' moment o f time ' \nrather than looking ahead  at the emerging\
  \  threats to the vessel . It is about as likely as \nnot that distraction occurred\
  \ to some degree through their engaging in conversation \nwith the passengers. \
  \ \n3.13. Both  radars were set on short range  for the entire pilotage. It is very\
  \ likely that the Leila \nJo would have been visible by radar much earlier  had\
  \ the range scale been cycled out \nto 6 NM  or more. The pilot was not aware of\
  \ the fishing vessel's  presence. \nConsequently,  there was no  mention of it when\
  \ the pilot handed the conduct of the \nvessel  to the master.  At that time the\
  \ Leila Jo  was an emerging  collision risk, less than 5 \nNM ahead with a closing\
  \ speed of about 16 knots  and rising  as the vessel 's speed \nincreased after\
  \ disembarking the pilot . \n3.14. With the pilot gone and the master having accepted\
  \ the conduct of the vessel , it would \nhave been good practice  for the master\
  \ to  be assessing the vessel 's position and \nmonitoring for other traffic in\
  \ preparation for han ding the cond uct to the third officer \nonce the pilot had\
  \ disembarked. Instead,  the master  was al most certainly distracted by \nthe presence\
  \ of the passengers on the bridge.  \n3.15. When the third officer returned to the\
  \ bridge and began to look ahead, t hey saw the \nlights of  the Leila Jo , yet\
  \ it was  not until the Leila Jo  appeared on the 3 NM radar ra nge \nthat the third\
  \ officer began plotting it s progress. Once plotting started the third officer\
  \ \nrealised the threat , and was heard on the voyage data recorder  audio  recording\
  \ \nattempting  to engage the master on five occasions .  \n3.16. The master's act\
  \ ion of altering the Rose Harmony 's course 10 degrees to starboard \nlikely put\
  \ the two vessel s on a collision course.  Prior to that the Leila Jo  had been\
  \ \ntracking to pass marginally down the vessel 's starboard side  at its closest\
  \ point of \napproach, as described by the third officer.  \n3.17. When the master\
  \ ordered the helm to be put hard over to starboard, the correct sound \nsignal\
  \ to have made on the vessel 's whistle was one short blast, which would have \n\
  \ \nFinal Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page 14 >>\n \n been the signal for letting\
  \ the Leila Jo  know that \"I am altering my course to \nstarboard \"19. However\
  \ , the master made one long continuous blast . \n3.18. The International Chamber\
  \ of Shipping 's Bridge Procedures Guide describes an \neffective bridge team as\
  \ one that \"will manage efficiently all the resources that are \navailable and\
  \ promote go od communication and teamwork\". This is particularly \nimportant during\
  \ an emergency situation when an effecti ve response will depend on \ngood communication\
  \ and co -ordinated actions . \n3.19. Good  communication is a cornerstone of bridge\
  \ resource management.  One known \nbarrier to good communication is what is commonly\
  \ referred to as a power -distance \nrelationship , typically w hen a subordinate\
  \ is required to challenge a superior , in this \ncase the third officer challenging\
  \ the master.  \n3.20. One technique to overcome a power -distance relationship\
  \  is the use of  graded \nassertiveness communication . Communication escalates\
  \ from probing to alerting  to \nchallenging , and eventually  to emergency. The\
  \ third officer was heard  probing and \nalerting the master to the situation  on\
  \ the voyage data recorder's  audio recording , but \ndid not take it to the next\
  \ level of challenge or  emergency. When it was obvious to the \nthird officer that\
  \ the master was not engaged with the threat, the correct thing for the \nthird\
  \ officer to have done would have been to suggest that they, or ask permission to\
  \ , \ntake earlier and more substantial action to avoid the collision . Finally,\
  \ the third officer \ncould have overridden the master's conduct of the vessel \
  \ and taken the required \naction . \n3.21. The passengers being on the bridge during\
  \ the pilotage was problematic.  Their \npresence affected the bridge team' s ability\
  \ to  manage the conduct of the vessel  \neffectively . The operator of  the Rose\
  \ Harmony had included guidance in its  safety \nmanagement system to mitigate the\
  \ risk of distraction to the bridge team. The guidance included this paragraph:\
  \  \nEntry of personne l to the bridge shall be controlled so that no person who\
  \ is \nnot directly related to the o peration o n the b ridge & its equipment, \n\
  navigational duties, command centre duties in case of emergencies or to \naddress\
  \ urgent matters related to vessel operations ca n affect the alertness \nor focus\
  \ of the bridge team.  \n3.22. This statement did not prevent passengers being on\
  \ the bridge , but it was clear in its \nintent that passengers' presence should\
  \ not adversely affect the bridge team \nperformance at times of critical navigat\
  \ ion. \n3.23. Distraction by non -essential personnel on the bridge of a vessel\
  \ is not a new problem . \nThe International Maritime Organi zation conducted a\
  \ review of passenger  vessel  \noperations following the capsize of the cruise\
  \ ship  Costa Concordia . It published the \ndocument Maritime Safety Committee\
  \ 92/6 (MSC 92/6) Review of Operational Safety \nMeasures to Enhance the Safety\
  \ of Passenger Ships (s ubmitted by the International \nChamber of Shipping ). This\
  \ document includes a section defined as \"Access o f \nPersonnel to the Navigating\
  \ Bridge and Avoiding Distraction\"  (see Appendix  1). \n3.24. The Commission raised\
  \ distraction  as a concern in its report on the near grounding  in \n2004 of the\
  \ Cook Strait passenger ferry Aratere while transiting the entrance to Tory \n \n\
  \ \n19 Maritime Rules Part 22.34(a).  \n \nFinal Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page\
  \ 15 >>\n Channel20. The presence of passengers on the bridge leading up to the\
  \ critical turn \nmay have distracted the master and the officer of the watch. \
  \ \nThe Leila Jo  \nSafety issue: The deckhand keeping  watch  on board the  Leila\
  \ Jo  was not sufficiently familiar  \nwith the  collision -prevention rules to\
  \  be left in sole charge of the watch . \n3.25. The deckhand who  was keeping a\
  \ navigational watch had been recruited and trained \nby the Leila Jo 's skipper\
  \ . Previously they had both been work ing on another fishing \nvessel  in the fleet\
  \ in similar capacit ies, and had been working for Pegasus Fishing for a \ntotal\
  \ of 12 years.  \n3.26. The deck crew s usually kept  two-hour watc hes while the\
  \ skipper was resting , with \ninstructions to wake the skipper  when needed . \n\
  3.27. The operator had a fatigue -management plan that included advice such as considering\
  \ \nhaving two crew on watch, shortening the watch periods  and using the wheelhouse\
  \ \nwatchkeeping alarm.  \n3.28. It is unlikely that the deckhand f ell asleep during\
  \ the watch or that fatigue was a factor . \nThe wheelhouse watchkeeping alarm was\
  \ active and would have alarmed if the \ndeckhand were  not moving.  The deckhand\
  \  was sufficiently alert to notice the presence \nof the Rose Harmony  on the radar\
  \ . \n3.29. However, the deck hand did not take the actions required by Mari time\
  \ Rule s Part 22. \nHaving detected the presence of the Rose Harmony , they made\
  \ no attempt  to plot the \nvessel  to determine if there was a risk of collision\
  \ . The deckhand, unaware of the \ndeveloping close quarter situation, left the\
  \ wheelhouse to wake up the master and \nprepare food , thereby leaving the wheelhouse\
  \ unmanned.    \n3.30. It was not until the skipper and deckhand  arrived in the\
  \ wheelhouse moments before \nthe collision that some kind of action was attempted.\
  \ Data from the Leila Jo 's chart \nplotter showed t he vessel turned to port just\
  \ before the collision occurred.  The \nskipper's intention was to turn to starboard\
  \ . Why the fishing vessel turned to port \ncould not be established with any certainty.\
  \ The Leila Jo  was in automatic steering at \nthe time , which  the skipper had\
  \ a sked the deckhand to disengage .  \nCrew training and certification  on board\
  \  the Leila Jo  \n3.31. The Leila Jo was under 2 4 metres in length. Under Maritime\
  \  Rules Part 31: Crewing and \nWatchkeeping  the minimum manning requirement was\
  \ a certified skipper and an \nengineer. In this case the skipper was certified\
  \ as both skipper and engineer.  The \nskipper was the only person on the vessel\
  \ who had received formal training  from an \napproved training provider  for keeping\
  \ a navigational watch.  \n3.32. Maritime  Rules Part  3121 states that the \"owner\
  \ and master of the ship and any person \nengaged in navigational watch keeping\
  \  duties on the ship must take account of the \nstandards for navigational watch\
  \ keeping \", which are defined in the  International \n \n \n20 Transport Accident\
  \ Investigation Commission Report 04 -214, Passenger freight ferry Aratere , loss\
  \ of mode \nawareness leading to near grounding, Tory Channel, 29 September 2004.\

  \ limits o r fishing vessels <24m in length \nbeyond inshore fishing limits but\
  \ within coastal or offshore limits  \n \nFinal Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page 16\

  \  for Fishing \nVessel Personnel  (STCW -F)22. \n3.33. The owner of  the Leila\
  \ Jo  (Pegasus Fishing) also operated f our other fishing vessel s. It \nwas common\
  \ practice for skipper s to be the only certified watchkeeper s when the \nvessels\
  \ were going on trips for multiple days. When i t was necessary for the skipper\
  \ of \na vessel to rest , a deckhand was required to keep the navigation watch.\
  \  \n3.34. On board  the Leila Jo  the deckhands knew that if they were unsure about\
  \ anything \nwhen they were keeping a navigational watch, they were to wake the\
  \ skipper \nimmediately. This was defined in the vessel 's Standing Orders, which\
  \ were posted in \nthe wheelhouse (see Figure 10). \n \nFigure 10: Annotated photograph\
  \ showing  the Leila Jo  Standing Orders for skipper s  \n3.35. The training and\
  \ recruitment of  deckhands on the vessels in  the Pegasus Fishing fleet \nwas the\
  \ responsibility of the skipper. The training for working as a deckhand was \noverseen\
  \ by an experienced deckhand.  New recruits  would also spend time working \nalongside\
  \ the skipper in the wheelhouse, learning how to keep a navigational watch \nand\
  \ how to hand le the boat .  \n3.36. Pegasus Fishing  had a ' Watchkeeping Training\
  \ Requirements ' checklist  that deckhands  \nhad to  complete. The checklist was\
  \ signed off by the skipper  after they were satisfied  \nthat a deckhand  was sufficiently\
  \ trained to  keep navigational watch (see Appendix 2 for \na copy of the ' watch\
  \ keeping training requirements ' checklist ). This on -the-job training \nusually\
  \ lasted about one week. After a deckhand completed watchkeeping training , \n \n\
  \ \n22 Chapter IV of STCW -F describes the suitable arrangements of a navigational\
  \ watch and states that a lookout \nmust be maintained in compliance with the COLR\
  \ EGs. \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page 17 >>\n they would be rostered\
  \ on with the other deckhands  to keep watch when the skipper \nwas resting .  \n\
  3.37. The deckhand who  was in the wheelhouse at the time of the accident had completed\
  \ \nthe watchkeeping training requirements set out in the company checklist and\
  \ had been \nsigned off by the skipper . However,  they were not completely familiar\
  \ with  the \nCOLREG s and did not appreciate the risk that the Rose Harmony  posed.\
  \  \n3.38. A system whereby deckhands are only trained in watchkeeping to a level\
  \ where the \nskipper is called in sufficient time when a collision or close -quarters\
  \ situation exists is \nnot consis tent with the requirements of Maritime Rules\
  \ Part 31 , which requires owners, \nskippers and watchkeepers to take account of\
  \ the standards of  STCW -F. This tr aining \nsystem was designed to allow skipper\
  \ s to rest ; however,  watchkeepers would have to \nwake skipper s whenever they\
  \ were uncertain, limiting the amount of rest the skipper s \ncould get.  \n3.39.\
  \ The Commission has recommended  that the owner enhance its training system so\
  \ as \nto upskill deckhands in watchkeeping practices that meets the minimum requirements\
  \ \nof Maritime Rule s Part 31 and adequately reduces the risk of accidents and\
  \ incidents \nresulting from poor watchkeeping practices . \n3.40. The Commission\
  \ has also recommended that Maritime New Zealand , when assessing \nor auditing\
  \ Maritime Operator Safety  Systems for fishing vessels, review the adequacy \n\
  of watchkeeping  training program mes for upskilling unqualified deckhands  to a\
  \ level \nthat meets good industry practice  and complies with the requirements\
  \ of Maritime \nRules Part 31.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2020- 201 \n<< Page 18 >>"
