","0.0","10.0","The pilot incorrectly perceived that the master of the IDAS Bulker was endangering his vessel by navigating towards a known navigational danger, which was not the case (4.1.1). This indicates a human error and assumption on the part of the pilot. However, the master had already mitigated the risk (4.1.1), so the impact of this error on the accident was limited.
","0.0","0.0","There is no evidence in the document suggesting that a lack of training or competency among the crew or pilot contributed to the incident.

","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide information suggesting that crew resource management issues contributed to the incident.
","0.0","30.0","The pilot handed control of the navigation of the IDAS Bulker to the master while the vessel was still in the compulsory pilotage area, without an arrangement for remote pilotage (4.4.4, 4.4.5). This is a clear deviation from safety procedures and Maritime Rules, which contributed significantly to the incident.
","0.0","20.0","The Port of Napier's Outward Pilotage procedures had not been aligned with the appropriate rules and legislation since 2003 (4.4.6). Additionally, no one in the Regional Council or the Port Authority, and none of the pilots themselves, realized that the procedures for outward pilotage were in error (4.5.6). This indicates a lack of a strong safety culture that could have prevented the incident.
","0.0","10.0","The master of the IDAS Bulker mitigated the risk of navigating closer to Pania Reef by confirming his assessment with the second officer and fixing the position of the vessel more frequently (4.2.8). This shows that some level of risk management was in place, but the overall incident suggests that there were shortcomings in the risk management and analysis processes, particularly in the adherence to pilotage procedures.
","0.0","23.333","The incident occurred due to non-compliance with Maritime Rules, specifically the requirement to have a licensed pilot in control of the vessel within the pilotage area (4.4.4). The Port of Napier's practices were in breach of these rules (4.4.4), and the pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the Napier Pilotage Area (4.5.1). This lack of compliance with regulatory requirements was a significant factor in the incident.
","5.774","6.667","The pilot's incorrect perception of the master's actions (4.1.1) and the master's decision to navigate south of North Pania Buoy (4.2.1) indicate issues with situational awareness. However, since the master had mitigated the risk and the weather did not contribute to the incident (4.1.3), the impact of situational awareness on the accident was somewhat limited.
