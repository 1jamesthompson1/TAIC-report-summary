- Napier pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the Napier Pilotage Area and that the outward pilotage limit did not exist.

The pilotage areas marked on the navigational charts and contained in nautical publications did not align with the Maritime Rules.
