  \ The pilot perceived  that the master of the IDAS Bulker  was endangering his vessel\
  \ by \nnavigating towards a known navigational danger (Pania Reef) .  However, this\
  \ was not the case  \nas the master had mitigated the risk , as discussed below\
  \ .   \n4.1.2.  The reported incident arose after the pilot had left the IDAS Bulker\
  \ , which led the Commission \nto scrutinise the pilotage and operational practices\
  \ and procedures at Port of Napier .   \n4.1.3.  The w eather at the time of the\
  \ incident was reported  to be a northerly wind,  Beaufort force 4 \n(11-16 knots)\
  \ with a slight sea and swell.  The visibility was good with broken cloud cover\
  \ ; \nhowever , as it was just after new moon there would have been little natural\
  \ light .  The weather \ndid not contribute to the incident.  \n4.1.4.  The following\
  \  analysis discusses what caused the IDAS Bulker  to be navigated to the south\
  \ of \na north cardinal buoy  and the robustness of the safety system for the port,\
  \ particularly \nregarding navigational risk and the need to carry a licens ed pilot.\
  \   \n4.2. Navigation  and buoyage  \n4.2.1.  The master of the IDAS Bulker  was\
  \ concerned that the predicted closest point of approach of \nthe inbound vessel\
  \ to his vessel was less than he was comfortable with , so he called the other \n\
  vessel to agree on passing arrangements , as the pilot had suggested he should .\
  \  The master \nand second officer then determined that  a greater separation could\
  \ be achieved by taking the \nIDAS Bulker  south of North Pania Buoy.  The master\
  \ then opted to take that route, where there \nwas sufficiently d eep water .  \
  \ \n4.2.2.  Although the IDAS Bulker  was heavily laden, to within 30 millimetres\
  \ of its maximum draught , \nand was slow to manoeuvre , there was sufficient water\
  \ depth for the vessel to navigate safely \non the intended course to the south\
  \ of North Pania Buoy.   The master mitigated the risk \nfurther by instigating\
  \ a more frequent  position -fixing regime of every 2 or 3 minutes , as was \nseen\
  \ on the vessel's navigational charts that were in use . \n4.2.3.  When the pilot\
  \ called the master to advise him to turn hard to port , the master instinctively\
  \ \nobeyed and brought the vessel back to port until he checked again that he had\
  \ a sufficient \ndepth of water.  The vessel , as far as both the master and the\
  \ pilot were concerned , was not \nunder the control of the pilot.  The pilot was\
  \ advising the master as a \"concerned seafarer \" \nthat he was heading  into danger.\
  \   \n4.2.4.  Section 200 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994 states that Maritime\
  \ New Zealand is the \nnational authority  responsible for : \nthe management of\
  \ all navigational aids on or near t he coasts of New Zealand \nand the adjacent\
  \ seas except those a person (including a local authority) who \noperates a port\
  \ must provide for that facility (an operator) and is responsible for \nthem (Government\
  \ of New Zealand, 1994) .   \n4.2.5.  Maritime New Zealand produce d a publication\
  \ , \"New Zealand's system of buoys and \nbeacons \", which  explain ed the buoyage\
  \ and \"beaconage \" system in New Zealand waters and \nthe recommended requirements\
  \ for aids to navigation in harbours and their approach \nchan nels (Maritime New\
  \ Zealand, 2008) .  This publication state d that the waters of New \nZealand and\
  \ adjacent islands were  marked for safe navigation using the International \nAssociation\
  \ of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) System \"A\" \n\
  Maritime Buoyage System.   \n4.2.6.  North Pania Buoy  was classified under IALA\
  \ System \"A\" as a north cardinal mark and had the \nrequired distinctive flashing\
  \ white light fitted.  A north cardinal mark indicates that the deepest \nand safest\
  \ water lies in the direction indicated, in this case to the north, and the marks\
  \ should \nbe passed to that side.  However, it does not mean that the  north cardinal\
  \ mark cannot be \nsafely passed to the south by vessels that have sufficiently\
  \ shallow draught s.   \n \nFinal report 13 -202 \n<< Page 9 >>\n 4.2.7.  North\
  \ Pania Buoy  had been moved to its present position from a position closer to the\
  \ reef  \nsome  time prior to 2001 .  The Port of Napier  could no t provide any\
  \ documentation that \nexplained the reasons for the buoy being moved, but advised\
  \ the Commission verbally that the \nmove was to put an isolated rock with a swept\
  \ depth of 13.7 metres below  chart datum to the \nsouth of the buoy, as the rock\
  \  could b e considered a hazard  to vessels close to or at the 12-\nmetre maximum\
  \ draught for containerships visiting the port.   \n4.2.8.  Hawke 's Bay Regional\
  \ Council and Port of Napier submitted that the master had endangered \nhis vessel\
  \ by going south of North Pania  Buoy.  They were correct in noting that it would\
  \ \nordinarily be prudent to pass north of North Pania Buoy .  However , because\
  \ the pilot was not \non board and had not arranged remote piloting , the master\
  \ exercise d his best judgement and \ndecided that he could  safely pass the buoy\
  \ on the \"wrong side\".  Furthermore , he mitigated \nthe risk  of navigating closer\
  \ to Pania Reef  by confirming his assessment with the second \nofficer and fixing\
  \ the position of the vessel more frequently.   \nFinding s \n1 The master of the\
  \ IDAS B ulker  was concerned that the inbound vessel's predicted \nclosest point\
  \ of approach to his vessel was too close .   \n2 The master of the IDAS Bulker\
  \ , after evaluating the risks , decided to take his \nvessel south of North Pania\
  \ Buoy  so as to increase the distance between his \nvessel and the inbound  vessel.\
  \  \n3 The master mitigated the additional risk of taking the vessel closer to the\
  \ reef by \nconfirming with the second officer the depth of water available and\
  \ fixing the \nposition of the vessel more frequently.  \n4.3. Legislation  \n4.3.1.\
  \  The reported incident occurred when the vessel was within a compulsory pilotage\
  \ area but \nwithout a pilot on board.  In New Zealand the statutory provisions\
  \ relating to pilots are \ncontained in several Acts and Rules.  The Local Government\
  \ Act 1974 makes regional \nauthorities responsible for determining requirement\
  \ s for compulsory pilotage . \n4.3.2.  Maritime Rules Part 90, Pilotage, was issued\
  \ under the terms of the Maritime Transport Act \n1994, and had been amended several\
  \ times sin ce the original Part came into force in 1999.  \nThe original Part was\
  \ amended in its entirety in 2003 and further amended twice in 2010 .  \nThe relevant\
  \ parts of the Part in force on the date of the incident are contained in Appendix\
  \ 2.   \n4.3.3.  The original Maritim e Rules Part 90 , which commenced in 1999\
  \ , stated that:  \nA master of a ship that proceeds in a pilotage district, other\
  \ than in any waters \nwhere bylaws provide that pilotage is not compulsory, must\
  \ ensure that a pilot \nwho has been appointed or licensed to ac t in that district\
  \ is carried on board the \nship.   \n4.3.4.  Pilotage \"districts \" became pilotage\
  \ \"areas \" in Maritime Rule s Part 90 when the rule was  \nrevised in 2003.  The\
  \ area for Napier specified in the schedule to the rule was:  \nThe area comprising\
  \ all port waters  between latitudes  39\xB025'S and 39\xB029'S, to \nthe west of\
  \ longitude 176\xB059'E.  (Port limits: the seaward limit of the port is the \n\
  arc of a circle radius 3 \xBD miles centred on East Pier Light (39\xB028'.7S, \n\
  176\xB053'.7E))   \nThis pilotage area is the same as that shown in the Hawke's\
  \ Bay Regional Council Navigation \nSafety Bylaws (see Appendix 4).  In the 2010\
  \ amendment to Maritime Rule s Part 90 the \nvessel size limits were changed to:\
  \ \"500 gross tonnage or 40 metres length overall\".   \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\nFinal\

  \ of a pilot \nSafety issue - The IDAS Bulker  was not under the control of a licensed\
  \ pilot when navigating \nwithin a pilotage area , contrary to the requirements\
  \ of the Maritime Rules and the Hawke's \nBay Regional Council Navigation Safety\
  \ B ylaws.  \n4.4.1.  The Nautical Institute's publication on pilotage and ship\
  \ -handling states that:  \nA vessel's master is charged with the responsibility\
  \ for the safety of the vessel \nand the efficient prosecution of the voyage.  Pilots\
  \ are engaged to assist with \nnavigation in conf ined waters and to facilitate\
  \ port approach, berthing, un -\nberthing and departure.  The vessel's master carries\
  \ the ultimate responsibility \nand has the right to take over from the pilot in\
  \ cases, albeit rare, where \ninexperience or misjudgement [of the pilot ] can hazard\
  \ a vessel (Nautical \nInstitute, 1990).   \n4.4.2.  The Commission was unable to\
  \ source a copy of the relevant regional bylaws in force in 1999, \nso it could\
  \ not determine whether  pilotage had previously not been compulsory in a part of\
  \  the \nNapier Pilotage Area for an outbound vessel.  However, this would have\
  \ been unlikely as it \nwould  have allowed  piloted and non -piloted vessels within\
  \ the same area.  The requirement to \ncarry a pilot while in a pilotage area for\
  \ vessels that met or exceeded the limits set in the Rule \n(at 40 metres or over\
  \ for Napier at the time) was introduced in the 2003 amendment to \nMaritime Rules\
  \ Part 90 : Pilotage.  \n4.4.3.  The practice of Port of  Napier pilots was to \
  \ board incoming vessel s in the vicinity of either of \nthe designated pilot stations\
  \ (see Figure 3) and take control of the navigation of the vessel s \ninto the port.\
  \  When a vessel departed the port a pilot would board the vessel at the berth and\
  \ \ntake control of the navigation until it was  approximately abea m South Pania\
  \ Buoy.  The pilot \nwould then show the master the appropriate course for the vessel\
  \ to follow and the position of \nthe navigation buoys , before  hand ing control\
  \ of the navigation back to the master and \ndeparting the vessel.  The pilots did\
  \ not su ggest to masters, or believe themselves, that they \nretained control of\
  \ outward vessel s while they remained in the pilotage area.    \n4.4.4.  The appropriate\
  \ authority, in this case Hawke's Bay Regional Council, had deemed that a pilot\
  \ \nwas required to be in control o f the navigation of the vessel within the pilotage\
  \ area .  Since \n2003 t he procedure s used by Napier pilots  and contained in\
  \ Port of Napier's Outward Pilotage \nprocedures (see Appendix 3) have contravened\
  \  the Maritime R ules.  By hand ing control of the \nnavigation to the master \
  \ and leaving the vessel , the pilot placed the master in the position of \nnavigating\
  \ his vessel within a pilotage area in contravention of the Maritime Rules.  Therefore\
  \ \nthe practice of pilots leaving vessels before reaching the published pilotage\
  \ limit was in \nbreach of the Maritime Rules .   \n4.4.5.  Had the pilot remained\
  \ on board until the vessel was clear of the pilotage area , or at least \nuntil\
  \ the vessel was clear of North Pania Buoy ,  the pilot's  knowledge of the area\
  \ and \nfamiliarity with manoeuvring vessels in close proximity to each other might\
  \ have assured the \nmaster that he could maintain the originally agreed passage\
  \ plan.   \nFindings:  \n4 The pilot handed control of the navigation of the IDAS\
  \ Bulker  to the master while \nthe vessel was still in the compulsory pilotage\
  \ area, and without an arrangement \nfor remote pilotage.   \n5 When  the pilot\
  \ hand ed control of the navigation of the vessel back to the master, \nthe master\
  \ was placed in the position of navigati ng his vessel within a pilotage \narea\
  \ in contravention of the Maritime Rules.   \n6 The procedures used by Napier pilots\
  \ as contained in Port of Napier's Outward \nPilotage procedures had not been aligned\
  \ with the appropriate rules and \nlegislation since 2003.   \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n\
  \ Final report 13 -202  4.5. Pilotage areas     \nSafety issue - Napier pilots were\
  \ unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service \nthroughout the whole\
  \ of the Napier Pilotage Area  and that the outward pilotage limit was not \nlegal\
  \ .   \n4.5.1.  It could not be determined when the practice began of the outward\
  \ pilots leaving vessel s \napproximately abeam of South Pania Buoy .  From interviews\
  \ with the pilots it appeared that  \nthe practice was in place prior to 2002 .\
  \   \n4.5.2.  The 2001 , 2004 and 2007 Sailing Directions for New Zealand (New Zealand\
  \ Pilot  book ), \nproduced by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office2, note d that\
  \ the pilot \"usually \ndisembarks the vessel at the seaward end of the dredged\
  \ entrance channel \".  The 2010 \nedition of the Sailing Directions note d that\
  \ the pilot usually depart ed \"seaward  of the outward \npilotage limit \".   \n\
  4.5.3.  An email dated 7 December 2005 from t he Hawke 's Bay Regional Council harbourmaster3\
  \ to \nLand Information New Zealand (see Appendix 5) state d that the definition\
  \ of the outward limit \nwas saved from \"The present HBRC [Hawke's Bay Regional\
  \ Council] Navigation Safety Bylaws \n2002\" and  this define d an \"inward \" pilotage\
  \ limit that was  smaller than that shown on the \nofficial navigational chart of\
  \ the area and define d the outward limit.  The only part of this \nchange reflected\
  \ in subsequent navigational chart s was the insertion of the outward pilotage \n\
  limit.    \n4.5.4.  Port of Napier submitted that its pilotage procedures and practices\
  \ were no different from \nthose of a number of  other ports in New Zealand , and\
  \ the Commission agreed .  However , a \ndifference occurred in that no other port\
  \ in New Zealand had an outward pilotage area that \nwas different from the inward\
  \ pilotage area.  All other ports in New Zealand had pilotage area s \nas described\
  \ in the Maritime Rules.   \n4.5.5.  The harbourmaster noted in the email that \"\
  Pilotage of outward vessels between 'B' Buoy \n(position Lat 39\xB0 27.935 [S?]\
  \ Long 176\xB0 54.86E ) and the 'outward ' limits may be conducted \nby VHF [very\
  \ -high-frequency radio] from the pilot boat provided such procedure is incorporated\
  \ \nin the 'Passage Plan ' and has been agreed by the Master of the vessel\"  (see\
  \ Figure 3) .  \nAlthough this statement set out correctly the procedure to be followed,\
  \ albeit for the short \ndistance mentio ned and not to the extent of the full pilotage\
  \ area, this procedure was not \nfollowed through into the pilot procedures of Port\
  \ of Napier , or Port of Napier 's outward \npassage plan s.  Further , according\
  \ to Maritime Rules Part 90 : Pilotage, that exception was  \nconfined to circumstances\
  \ when  a transfer of the pilot would be unsafe.   \n4.5.6.  It is difficult to\
  \ comprehend that no-one in  the Regional Council  or the Port Authority and none\
  \ \nof the p ilots themselves had noticed  the errors in Port of Napier 's procedures\
  \ for o utward \npilotage , which were  described in nautical publications  and\
  \ in the pilotage areas  marked on \nthe navigational charts .  The pilotage areas\
  \ and procedures  did not align with the Maritime \nRules or the Regional Council's\
  \ Navigation Safety Bylaws.  Two o pportunities to identify and \ncorrect the error\
  \ s were missed: the first  when  the Bylaws were  amended in 2007 , and the \n\
  second  when the harbourmaster reviewed the Bylaws in 2012.   \n \n \n         \
  \                                               \n2 Often referred to as \"Pilots\
  \ \", Sailing Directions provide  essential information on all aspects of navigation\
  \ for \nuse by the merchant mariner on all classes of ocean -going vessel .  Sailing\
  \ Directions complement Admiralty \nStandard Nautical Charts and provide worldwide\
  \ coverage in 74 volumes.   The Sailing Directions produced by \nthe United Kingdom\
  \ Hydrographic Office are consid ered one of the foremost publications of this type\
  \ in the \nworld and are used on ocean -going vessels worldwide.  \n3 References\
  \ to the Hawke's Bay Regional Council harbourmaster are to the incumbents during\
  \ the periods \nindicated.   \n \nFinal report 13 -202 \n<< Page 13 >>\n Findings:\
  \  \n7 When Maritime Rules Part 90 was revised in 2003 , the pilotage area s then\
  \ in \nforce were included.  The Napier Pilotage Area defined in both the Maritime\
  \ Rules \nand the Hawke's Bay Regional Council Navigation Safety Bylaws in 2003\
  \ has \nremained the same until the present day.   \n8 No-one in the Regional Council\
  \ or the Port Auth ority and none of the pilots \nthemselves realised that the procedures\
  \ for outward pilotage were in error.  The \npilotage areas marked on the navigational\
  \ charts and contained in nautical \npublications did not align with the Maritime\
  \ Rules and the Regional Cou ncil's \nNavigation Safety Bylaws.    \n \n  \n \n\n\
