Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Navigation and buoyage: The master of the IDAS Bulker made a decision to navigate south of North Pania Buoy to increase the distance between his vessel and the inbound vessel. The master mitigated the risk by confirming the depth of water available and fixing the position of the vessel more frequently.
2. Use of a pilot: The pilot handed control of the navigation of the IDAS Bulker to the master while the vessel was still in the compulsory pilotage area, in contravention of the Maritime Rules. The procedures used by Napier pilots for outward pilotage have not been aligned with the appropriate rules and legislation since 2003.
3. Pilotage areas: Napier pilots were unaware of the requirement to provide a pilotage service throughout the whole of the Napier Pilotage Area, and the outward pilotage limit was not legal. No one in the Regional Council or the Port Authority realized that the procedures for outward pilotage were in error.
