Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Navigation and buoyage: The master of the IDAS Bulker made a decision to navigate south of North Pania Buoy to increase the distance between his vessel and the inbound vessel. The master mitigated the risk by confirming the depth of water available and fixing the position of the vessel more frequently.
2. Use of a pilot: The pilot handed control of the navigation of the IDAS Bulker to the master while the vessel was still in the compulsory pilotage area, in contravention of the Maritime Rules. The procedures used by Napier pilots for outward pilotage have not been aligned with the appropriate rules and legislation since 2003.
3. Legislation: The IDAS Bulker was not under the control of a licensed pilot when navigating within a pilotage area, contrary to the requirements of the Maritime Rules and the Hawke's Bay Regional Council Navigation Safety Bylaws.
