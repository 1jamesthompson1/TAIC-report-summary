  \ during a de -stress ing operation  \n3.6.3.  On 6 December 2011 , 15 days after\
  \ the d e-stress work , one of the new weld s failed.  The rail \nthat contained\
  \ the weld failure was repl aced on the same day.  \n3.6.4.  One week later, o n\
  \ 13 December 2011 , a track  buckle failure was found 8 m from the site of \nthe\
  \ weld failure .  A track buckle occurs when hot weather causes  rail to expand\
  \ , causing \ncompression forces.  When these forces exceed the resi stance provided\
  \ by the sleepers and \nballast , the track can buckle sideways  (see Figure 6)\
  \ . \n \nFigure 6  \nAn example of a track buckle  \n3.6.5.  The track buckle site\
  \ was stabilised and a short length of replacement rail inserted on the \nsame da\
  \ y.  On 14 and 15 December 2011 maintenance staff returned to the site to complete\
  \ \nthe repair work , which included extracti ng, shifting and inserti ng a 20 m\
  \ length of rail through \nthe area and welding track joints.  \n3.6.6.  Records\
  \ show that on 19 December 2011 , in addition to the de -stress ing work required\
  \ , there \nwas insufficient ballast on each side of the track in the vicinity of\
  \ the  track buckle  site. \n \n\n \n4. Analysis  \n4.1. Introduction  \n4.1.1.\
  \  Mainline derailments have the potential to cause serious harm to people and damage\
  \ to \ntrains and the rail infrastructure.  They do therefore have significant implications\
  \ for transport \nsafety.  Following this derailment,  the derailed wagon pass ed\
  \ over two level crossings  where \nthere was a greater risk to the public  waiting\
  \ for the train to pas s by. \n4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses possible\
  \ factors leading to the derailment and a safety issue \nrelating to the quality\
  \ of track mainten ance and the system for checking that identified track \ndefects\
  \ had been adequately repaired.  \n4.2. Possible factors contr ibuting to the derailment\
  \  \n4.2.1.  It has not been possible to attribute the derailment definitively to\
  \ one single factor.  The twist \ndefects found in the track following the accident\
  \ would have been one factor.  However, \nbetween the derailment occurrences on\
  \ 8 Mar ch and 3 May, a total of 600 freight trains and \n40 passenger trains had\
  \ passed through the area without derailing.  It is known that the twist \ndefects\
  \ were present during that whole period.  The derailment cannot therefore be solely\
  \ \nattributed to the track  defects, otherwise some of those trains should have\
  \ derailed as well.  \nOther factors must have been involved.  \n4.2.2.  The Commission\
  \ has  previously  investigated a series of derailments , in rail inquiry 07 -1024.\
  \  \nThat report discusses the phenomenon of dynamic int eraction .  Dynamic interaction\
  \ was the \nmost likely cause of both this derailment and that six and a half  weeks\
  \ prior.   The 07 -102 \nreport described dynamic  interaction as follows : \nA\
  \ train derailment attributed to dynamic interaction occurs when the \ntrack ge\
  \ ometry, wagon condition, wagon loading and train speed are \nindividually within\
  \ tolerance limits, or marginally in excess, but not to an \nextent that each variation\
  \ on its own is sufficient to be a prime cause of \nthe derailment.  However, when\
  \ in combination  these conditions can \nresult in a derailment.  \nWith dynamic\
  \ interaction derailments, the speed of the train does not \nnecessarily mean the\
  \ train was travelling too fast.  A 1990 publication by \nan International Government\
  \ Research Program on Track Train \nDynam ics on Train Derailment Cause Finding\
  \ identified the usual speed \nfor 'bogie hunting '5 derailments as being above\
  \ 75 km  per hour .  \nHunting increases the lateral forces that lead to wheel climb6\
  \ and in \nextreme cases cause wheel lift, often on straight track.   This means\
  \ that \nwhile speed can be a factor in derailments attributed to dynamic \ninteraction,\
  \ this is not necessarily a reflection of driver technique but \nmore an unfortunate\
  \ combination of the condition of the track, the state \nof the wagon and the speed\
  \  at which the wagon was travelling.  \nA wagon has a complex suspension system\
  \ through which it resonates \nat a natural harmonic frequency when subjected to\
  \ some external force.  \nIf a force is applied that causes the wagon to roll, the\
  \ springs on one \nside of t he bogie compress.  The energy stored in the springs\
  \ then feeds \nback into the wagon body to compress the springs on the opposite\
  \ side \nof the bogie.  This behaviour continues at a constant frequency and \n\
  amplitude unless an additional force is applied.   Shou ld an additional \n    \
  \                                                    \n4 Rail inquiry 07-102 (incorporating\
  \ inquiry  07-111) , freight train mainline derailments, various locations on \n\
  the national network . \n5 Bogie hunting i s the sideways motion of a bogie travelling\
  \ at speed, caused by irregularities in the track \nand/or on the wheel.  \n6 Wheel\
  \ climb is the mounting of a wagon wheel above its normal contact with the top of\
  \ a rail head to a point \nwhere the wheel r im loses its guidance contact with\
  \ the inside face of the rail head.  The wheel is then free to \ntravel in a different\
  \ direction from  that of the rail . \nFinal report RO -2012 -103 \n<< Page 9 >>\n\
  \ force be applied in phase, such as when passing over track with \nirregularities,\
  \ the amplitude of oscillations can increase rapidly and lead \nto wheel unloading7\
  \ and eventually wheel climb.  A wagon's ability to \nresist such a condition is\
  \ re duced when the friction wedge8 heights are \nat or near the condemning limit\
  \ . \n4.2.3.  In this case the wagon that first derailed was found to comply with\
  \ the KiwiRail maintenance \nlimits.  The friction wedge heights were 29  mm compared\
  \ with the maximum allowable 39  \nmm.  The way the wagon was loaded was compliant\
  \ with KiwiRail's freight handling code.  \n4.2.4.  The lathe work (see section\
  \ 3.2) had recondition ed the wheel treads to near -new condition .  \nThe rail\
  \ -mounted wheel -condition -monitoring systems installed at strategic loc ations\
  \  across \nthe rail network had not identified any wheel tread defects during the\
  \ period between the \nlathe work and the derailment.  \n4.2.5.  The heights of\
  \ the friction wedge s on the wagon bogies that had derailed in March averaged \
  \ \n32 mm compared with the allowa ble 39  mm.  There was no evidence that the mechanical\
  \ \ncondition of either wagon had contributed to the derailment.  Both wagons had\
  \ undergone \nscheduled 24 -monthly mechanical examinations only one and three months\
  \ respectively \nbefore derailing.  \n4.2.6.  There was no thing untoward in the\
  \ manner in which the train s were being handled by the two \ndriver s.  They had\
  \ their train s' speed s under the 40 km/h limit,  yet when the trains passed \n\
  over the series of  track twist defects one wheel -set lifted and derailed.  \n\
  4.2.7.  The track t wist defects are highly likely to have caused some degree of\
  \ oscillation  as the \nwagons passed over them.  If this had occurred in phase\
  \ with the natural harmonic frequency \nof the wagon for the speed  at which it\
  \ was travelling, this combination could have b een \nsufficient to cause the derailment.\
  \  However , as none of these factors is measurable it is \ndifficult to say with\
  \ any certainty the degree to which each contributed to the derailment . \n4.3.\
  \ Repair and maintenance  \nSafety issue - The system for recording and mo nitoring\
  \ the effect s of track repair and \nmaintenance was not picking up that the repair\
  \ and maintenance work was not  remedy ing \nidentified track  defects.  \n4.3.1.\
  \  Records showed that on 10 occasions between July 2009 and November 2011, KiwiRail's\
  \ \ntrack -evaluation ca r had identified and reported the same pattern of track\
  \ twist defects  that \ncontributed to this and the derailment six and a half  weeks\
  \ prior .  On each occasion \nmaintenance staff had carried out repairs.  However,\
  \ either the repairs had not remed ied the \ntrack fault s or the root cause of\
  \ the defects had not been addressed, because they had \nreappeared with the next\
  \ pass of the track -evaluation car.  KiwiRail had not require d track \nmaintenance\
  \ staff to record the nature of the repair work undertaken , the materi als used\
  \  or \nthe methods applied .  No records had been  kept of the condition of the\
  \ track after each repair.  \n4.3.2.  The rail de -stressing work and the subsequent\
  \ track failures that should have been prevented \nby that work were another example\
  \ of the system not rec ording  the work done and monitoring \nits effectiveness.\
  \  \n4.3.3.  There is no evidence linking the rail d e-stressing work and the recurring\
  \ track twist defects, \nother than that they were in the same section of track,\
  \ under the control of the same \nmaintenance staff , and under the same rail infrastructure\
  \ management system.  \n                                                       \
  \ \n7 Wheel unloading is the unloading of  the weight being carried by a wheel,\
  \ or wheels , when a wagon rocks \nfrom side to side while passing over an area\
  \ of track with closely  spaced opposing rail height variations . \n8 Friction wedges\
  \ provide damping to the vertical and lateral movements between the two bogie side\
  \ frames \nand the bolster (see the bogie drawing in t he glossary on page vii).\
  \  The height of friction wedges is measured \nfor wear during mechanical examinations.\
  \  \n \n\n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report RO -2012 -103 4.3.4.  Soon after this derailment\
  \ KiwiRail replaced the ballast and carried out rehabilitation work on \nthe ground\
  \ formation underlying the embankment.  \n4.3.5.  Since 2014 KiwiRail  has implemented\
  \ a national , compute rised , track infrastructure asset \nmanagement system known\
  \ as 'Maximo'.  A review of completed work is a feature of the \nsystem and provides\
  \ KiwiRail track engineers with detailed oversight of repair and \nmaintenance activities.\
  \  \n4.3.6.  A review of KiwiRail's track d atabase for the area between Rangitawa\
  \ and Maewa showed no \nevidence of the defects reappearing following three journeys\
  \ of the track -evaluation car during \n2015.  \n4.3.7.  KiwiRail now requires a\
  \ senior track engineer to review the track defect printout after each \ntrack-evaluation\
  \ car journey to identify and analyse the most serious defects.  Dependent \nupon\
  \ the type, number and severity of the defects identified , the following actions\
  \ are \nundertaken:  \n\uF0B7 an area track inspector re -evaluates the defects\
  \ identified by the t rack-evaluation car  \n\uF0B7 a field asset engineer establishes\
  \ the necessary defect -rectification work  \n\uF0B7 a field production engineer\
  \ assesses the nominated repair method s to ensure that the \nroot cause s of the\
  \ defect s are addressed and allocated appropriate resources . \n4.3.8.  Following\
  \ the heat buckle and weld failure, KiwiRail conducted an internal investigation\
  \ into \nthe track buckle , which identified the following concerns regarding the\
  \ quality of the track de -\nstress project completed three weeks previously and\
  \ also the lat er repairs completed at the \nweld failure site:  \n\uF0B7 recordings\
  \ of the track position in relation to track survey pegs were not completed \nfollowing\
  \ the de -stress project  \n\uF0B7 too much rail may have been cut out during the\
  \ de -stress project , causing the rail to \ncreep down the gradient under normal\
  \ train operations  \n\uF0B7 the rail used to replace the weld failure was unsuitable\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the ballast each side of the track was in a weak condition  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the longstanding track defects [the track twists]  remained.  \n4.3.9.  KiwiRail\
  \ has completed a re -examination program me of the procedures and resources used\
  \ to \nmanage track de -stressing work .  It has  created a new position , the 'de-stress\
  \ co -ordinator ', \nwho is responsible for scop ing all aspects of the work and\
  \ draw ing up a detailed plan for each \nsite identified for de -stressing . \n\
  The new procedures now require that:  \n\uF0B7 de-stress co -ordinators examine\
  \ track stability reports in addition to other data \nstreams to highlight known\
  \ and other track section sites where de -stressing is \nrequired  \n\uF0B7 staff\
  \  measure rail temp erature s to maintain up -to-date information relating to the\
  \ \nexisting stress levels in the identified track section sites  \n\uF0B7 an annual\
  \ de -stressing plan be compiled, prioritised and delivered by the de -stress \n\
  supervisor to the field asset engineer and agreemen t reached on the sites to be\
  \ de -\nstressed  \n\uF0B7 the de -stressing work be completed by field staff in\
  \ accordance with the detailed plan , \nand the track database updated  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the completed work site be audited by the de -stress co -ordinator for quality\
  \ \nassurance.  \n  \nFinal report RO -2012 -103 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.4. Mainli ne\
  \ derailment statistics  \n4.4.1.  In the reporting year ending 30 June 2005, 55\
  \ mainline derailments had occurred on the rail \nnetwork.  Since that date the\
  \ number of mainline derailments has declined.  Seven \nderailments were recorded\
  \ during the reporting year endin g 30 June 2015.  \n4.4.2.  Figure 7 has been compiled\
  \ using data supplied by KiwiRail.  It show s the declin e in mainline \nderailments\
  \ reported  by KiwiRail between 1 July 2004 and 30 June 2015, compared with \nKiwiRail's\
  \ capital expenditure on track renewals and its annu al gross rail tonnage.  The\
  \ trend \nlines indicate that the financial investment in track improvements has\
  \ positively contributed to \nthe reduction in derailments.  \n4.4.3.  Figure 7\
  \  shows that the capital expenditure (capex) on track renewals grew and peaked\
  \  in the \n2009-2012 period when  track -related  problems were encount ered in\
  \ the Maewa area.  \n \nFigure 7  \nMainline derailment trend statistics  \n4.4.4.\
  \  In view of the derailment statistics shown in Figure 7 and the safety actions\
  \ taken by KiwiRail, \nthe Co mmission has not made any recommendations . \nFinding\
  \ s \n1. The derailment was likely caused by dynamic interaction, which occurs when\
  \ the \ntrack geometry, wagon condition, wagon loading and train speed in combination\
  \ \ncan lead to wheel unloading and eventually whee l climb , result ing in derailment.\
  \  \n2. The wagon condition, the wagon loading and the speed of the train were all\
  \ within \nallowable tolerances.  The track twist defects were outside allowable\
  \ tolerances \nand according to KiwiRail standards should have been rectif ied at\
  \ least five weeks \nbefore the derailment.  \n3. The KiwiRail system for managing\
  \ track defects in the area of Maewa was not \nensuring : that  the root causes\
  \ of track defects were being identified; that repair \nwork was being properly\
  \ performed; and that the re pairs were effective. KiwiRail \nhas since taken safety\
  \ action s to address this issue . \n  020406080100120\nCapex on track renewals\
