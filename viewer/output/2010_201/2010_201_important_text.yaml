  \  \n4.1.1.  Death by entry into enclosed spaces on ships is not  a new phenomenon;\
  \ in fact for decades it \nhas been one of the most talked -about and well documented\
  \ risks facing crews in the \nmaritime industry.  \n4.1.2.  The Commission now discusses\
  \  why the 2 crew members died in this case, the inherent \ndangers created by the\
  \ carr iage of log cargoes at sea, and the procedures that should have \nbeen followed\
  \ to avoid the 2 deaths in this case.  \n4.1.3.  Also discussed are the survivability\
  \ aspects of this accident; that is, could the 2 crew members \nhave been saved?\
  \ It is not the purpose of thi s report to ascribe blame, but sometimes that \n\
  inference is unavoidable if the lessons are to be learned.  Without detracting from\
  \ the sincere \nefforts some crew members ma de to save the 2 colleagues collapsed\
  \ in the hold, some \nimportant lessons are discusse d that could benefit other\
  \ mariners reading this report.  \n4.2. Why the crew members died  \n4.2.1.  The\
  \ accident sequence started when the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space\
  \ \nwithout checking that the atmosphere was suitable for entry and without following\
  \ the \nappropriate safety precautions.  In this case, there was insufficient oxygen\
  \ in the hold to \nsustain life for more than a few minutes.  The presence of other\
  \ toxic gases such as CO and \nH2S would of themselves have been  likely to cause\
  \ similar incapacitation t hrough intoxication.  \nHowever, the effects of such\
  \ severe hypoxia would be supervening in a short time period.  \nWith such a rapid\
  \ onset of loss of useful consciousness, the crew would have been unlikely to \n\
  recognise the effect s of hypoxia in time to self -rescue from the oxygen -depleted\
  \ area.  \n4.2.2.  The Commission was unable to determine why the chief officer\
  \ who was second in command \non the vessel, had sailed on bulk carriers carrying\
  \ logs often during his career, was considered \nby his peers to be a competent\
  \ offi cer and in part was responsible for the safe working \npractices of the deck\
  \ crew, would enter an enclosed space without taking well  documented \nprecautions.\
  \  \n4.2.3.  Ironically number 5 cargo hold was not one mentioned by the master\
  \ as having excess water \nin it, so t here was no purpose for his going down there.\
  \  The master did refer to the rubber \nseal on number 5 hold access door needing\
  \ replacing, but this should have been easily \nchecked from the deck.  It is possible\
  \ that he mixed up the tasks associated with each c argo \nhold.  Delays for ships\
  \ engaged in any kind of charter can be costly , so the possibility that the \n\
  ship w ould be rejected as suitable for in -transit fumigation would have been a\
  \ strong driver to \nremedy the problems identified by the fumigation provider ,\
  \ possibly at the expense of taking \nappropriate precautions.  \n4.2.4.  The reasons\
  \ for the deck crew member choosing  to enter the enclosed space are easier to \n\
  rationalise.  He was not at the access door when the chief officer entered the cargo\
  \ hold, but \nonly heard t he bosun shout that the chief officer had fallen.  The\
  \ deck crew member then \nentered the accommodation to raise the alarm before proceeding\
  \ to the access.  The deck \ncrew member might not necessarily have been aware that\
  \ the chief officer had collapsed from  \nasphyxiation , a possible slip/trip/fall\
  \ scenario being quite feasible.  On arrival at the hold \naccess there was nobody\
  \ else there, the bosun having gone to get a rescue line.  Like the \nchief officer,\
  \ it could not be established what training the deck crew  member had received for\
  \ \nentry into enclosed spaces filled with log cargos, so it could not be ruled\
  \ out that his action to \nhelp the chief officer was a knowledge -based mistake,\
  \ one possibly heavily influenced by a \nstrong emotional motivation to assist a\
  \ c olleague, so close and visibly in obvious distress.  \n4.2.5.  In 1990, James\
  \ Reason in his book Human Error distinguished between 3 main groups of \nerror,\
  \ namely slips, lapses and mistakes.  He described knowledge -based mistakes as:\
  \  \nKnowledge -based thinking involves evaluating an unfamiliar or unusual situation\
  \ \nand deciding on a course of action.  Ideally, operational personnel would make\
  \ \ndecisions by following a carefully reasoned process involving considering all\
  \ the \n  \nReport 10 -201 \n<< Page 15 >>\n options and wei ghing up the risks\
  \ of various courses of action.  In reality \nhowever, things are not that simple.\
  \  Sometimes we do not consider all of the \nalternatives or we take mental short\
  \ cuts to arrive at a solution.  Or under the \npressure of having too little time\
  \ a nd too much to do, thinking becomes \u2015short \ncircuited\u2016 and we end\
  \ up deciding on an unsuitable course of action. Emotional \nfactors also exert\
  \ a powerful influence on decisions, and despite the most \nthorough training, no\
  \ one is immune to such pressures (Reason, 1990) .   \nThe scenario where the rescuer\
  \ has succumbed to the same fate as the person being rescued \nhas been all too\
  \ common in the maritime industry, and there are many examples of this \nincluded\
  \ in the IMO statistics, which are discussed in more detail below.  \n \nFinding\
  \  \n \nAccording to the autopsy reports , the chief officer and  the deck crew\
  \ member died from \nasphyxia due to oxygen deprivation, which  was consistent with\
  \ the depleted (about 3%) \nlevel of oxygen in the cargo hold they had entered immediately\
  \ before collapsing.  \n \n4.3. Dangers created by log cargos in enclosed spaces\
  \  \n4.3.1.  In 2009, total log exports from New Zealand were provisionally recorded\
  \ as being in excess of \n9 million m3 of which over 50 % was destined for China\
  \ (DANA Limited, 2010) .  To transport \nthis amount of logs would require more\
  \ than  200 shipments on vessels of a similar size to the \nTPC Wellington .  No\
  \ record could be found in the previous  10 years of a similar occurrence \nhappening\
  \ in a New Zealand port.  \n4.3.2.  Organic cargoes such as logs were known to deplete\
  \ oxygen in enclosed atmosphere s.  The \ndepleted oxygen is often replaced by other\
  \ gases injurious to the health, or fatal in sufficient \nquant ities, such as CO,\
  \ CO 2, H2S and h ydrocarbons  (Urban Svendberg, 2009) .  CO and CO 2 are \ncolourless\
  \ and odourless.  H2S is colourless and , although known as the \u2015rotten egg\
  \ smell\u2016 at \nconcentrations over 100  parts per million  causes paralysis\
  \ of the olfactory nerve and thus \nseems to be odourless and is extremely toxic\
  \ (Lewis, 1996) .  The main hydrocarbon emitted by \nlogs as they decompose is a\
  \ monoterpene, \u03B1 -pinene, which would have accounted for th e \nstrong pine\
  \ smell in the hold.  The chief officer would not have been able to detect the \n\
  presence of 3 of the toxic gases produced by the logs , but would have been able\
  \ to smell the \npresence of the monoterpene.  He would also have been unable to\
  \ detect, without the aid of \nan oxygen meter, the reduced oxygen content of the\
  \ atmosphere within the hold.  His first \nindication that something was \u2015\
  wrong\u2016 would have been as he started to succumb to the lack \nof oxygen and\
  \ the possible presence of the other toxic g ases, which as discussed above would\
  \ \nhave happened rapidly.  \n4.3.3.  The organic cargo, logs, in cargo hold number\
  \ 5 had depleted the amount of oxygen available \nin the access trunk to the hold,\
  \ as measured after the event, to such a degree that anyone \nentering the hold\
  \ without wearing breathing apparatus would have been affected virtually as \nsoon\
  \ as they entered the hold.  The Occupational Health and Safety Administration in\
  \ the \nUnited States of America has a standard of 20.8 % to 21.0 % as the normal\
  \ oxygen level in  the \natmosphere , and 19.5% or below is considered a low oxygen\
  \ level.  The National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health in the United\
  \ States of America produced a technical report on \nrespiratory protection that\
  \ noted the following signs and sympto ms were observable when a \nhuman body experienced\
  \ oxygen deficiency  (see below) :  \n  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Report 10 -201 Oxygen\
  \ % in atmosphere  Symptoms  \n16% to 12%  Deep breathing, accelerated heartbeat,\
  \ impaired attention, \nimpaired thinking, impaired coordination.  \n12% to 10%\
  \  Very faulty judg ment, very poor coordination, rapid fatigue \nfrom exertion\
  \ that may cause permanent heart damage, \nintermittent breathing.  \n10% and below\
  \  Nausea, vomiting, inability to perform vigorous movement or \nloss of all movement,\
  \ unconsciousness followed by death.  \nLess than 6%  Spasmodic breathing, convulsive\
  \ movements, death in \nminutes.  \nTable 6  \nObservable symptoms of oxygen deprivation\
  \ on the human body  \n4.3.4.  The initial reading of 1% at the second rung down\
  \ could have been representative of the hold \naccess atmosphere before the exterior\
  \ atmosphere mixed with it, hence the reading at the \nthird rung down some 15 minutes\
  \ later being 2%.  \n4.3.5.  Similar tests conducted the following day showed a\
  \ level of 3% at a depth of 3 m into the hold.  \nThe time of usefu l consciousness\
  \ at this level would have been in the range of 9 to 12 \nseconds from the time\
  \ of inhaling air at between 1% and 3%, this time being the average time \nfor oxygen\
  \ de -saturated air to circulate to the brain.  After 9 to 12 seconds the chief\
  \ offic er \nand the deck crew member would have become rapidly confused, poorly\
  \ co -ordinated and \nunable to hold on  to the ladder, so falling to the logs below.\
  \  Complete loss of consciousness \nwould have followed rapidly, and death within\
  \ 5 minutes.  The range of 1 % to 3 % therefore \nwas critically low and could not\
  \ sustain life for more than a few minutes.  \n \nFindings  \n \nOn entering the\
  \ cargo hold with a 3% level of oxygen, the chief officer and deck crew \nmember\
  \ would have had 9 to 12 seconds of useful consciousness to maintain a hold on \n\
  the access ladder; total unconsciousness rapidly following and death within 5 minutes.\
  \  \n \nOxygen levels in the cargo hold would have been depleted by the organic\
  \ decomposition \nof the logs and toxic gases such as CO, CO2 and H2S may also have\
  \ been present, \nphenomena well know n to the shipping industry and one that were\
  \  documented in the \ncargo handling procedures on board the TPC Wellington . \n\
  \ \n4.4. Entry into enclosed spaces  \n4.4.1.  An enclosed space was defined by\
  \ the IMO as being a space that had  any of the following \ncharacteristics; limited\
  \ openings for entry and exit, unfavourable natural ventilation, and not \nbeing\
  \ designed for continuous worker occupancy.  Enclosed spaces on ships such as cargo\
  \ \nholds, fuel and ballast tanks, void spaces, a nd cofferdams had been a source\
  \ of accidents \nand increased scrutiny by regulatory and safety authorities.  \
  \ \n4.4.2.  In 1997 the IMO introduced recommendations for entering enclosed spaces\
  \ and these \nsuperseded the recommendations already contained in Appendix F to\
  \ the bulk carrier code, \nwhich later became Appendix 7 of the bulk carrier code\
  \ that was current at the time of the \naccident.   \n4.4.3.  Despite the introduction\
  \ of the recommendations on entry into enclosed spaces by the IMO in \n1997, accidents\
  \ continued to happen an d became a subject of concern to the Marine \nAccident\
  \ Investigators International Forum (MAIIF) .  In 2009 it submitted a document to\
  \ the \nIMO calling for a revision of the procedures and citing at least 101 enclosed\
  \ space incidents \nresulting in 93 deaths and  96 injuries since the recommendations\
  \ had been  adopted (Marine \nAccident Investigator's International Forum, 2009)\
  \ .  In 2009, Maritime NZ issued Safety \nBulletin Issue 21 - September 2009, Enclosed\
  \ and Confined S paces Can Kill highlighting to \nthe maritime industry the dangers\
  \ of enclosed spaces (see Appendix 4).   \n  \nReport 10 -201 \n<< Page 17 >>\n\
  \ 4.4.4.  Having rules, regulations and guidelines does not in itself ensure compliance\
  \ with them, nor \ndoes simply repeating the rules  and regulations in on -board\
  \ documentation ensure \ncompliance.  The responsibility for ensuring compliance\
  \ with legislation and company \noperating procedures firstly rests with the ship\
  \ owner or operating company, then with senior \nstaff on board who have the res\
  \ ponsibility for ensuring compliance on board, then lastly with \nthe crew who\
  \ are performing the procedure.  It is this chain of responsibility that is espous\
  \ ed \nin the ISM Code, and if the chain is broken in some way the crew who are\
  \ most likely to \nencounter  an enclosed space scenario are at higher risk of having\
  \ an accident.   \n4.4.5.  The TPC Wellington 's shipboard management manual and\
  \ systems had been audited and \napproved by Korean Register under the ISM Code.\
  \  The manual contained references to the \nrequirements to  be followed when loading\
  \ log cargoes, the dangers associated with the cargo \nand procedures to be taken\
  \ if entry into an enclosed space was required.  However, TPC Korea \nCompany Limited\
  \ , although identifying the need for education and training onboard for \nemergency\
  \ response training and drills in the vessel procedures manual had not identified\
  \ the \nneed for an enclosed space rescue drill in the ship's emergency response\
  \ drill matrix.  \n4.4.6.  The SSM  failed to mitigate what was known to be a high-risk\
  \ to the crew.  N o record could be \nfound of specific training for the crew to\
  \ highlight the danger of entering enclosed cargo holds, \nnor had an enclosed space\
  \ drill been held.  Of the crew who had been made aware of the \ndangers, this awareness\
  \ stemmed from shore -based trai ning or training with other operator s. \n4.4.7.\
  \  The bosun asked the chief officer twice not to enter the hold because he knew\
  \ of the dangers.  \nAs previously mentioned , the Commission was unable to determine\
  \ what training  the chief \nofficer had received;  however, as the second most\
  \ senior officer on board the vessel he \nshould have been aware of the requirements\
  \ on enclosed space entry and these would have \nbeen included in his certificated\
  \ training (International Maritime Organization, 2005) .   \n \nFinding s \n \n\
  Being a dedicated log carrier , the risk of death by entering closed cargo holds\
  \ containing \nlogs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the\
  \ ship's emergency \nresponse training program me, yet no evidence could be found\
  \ in the  vessel's records for \nthe previous 3 months that such a drill or training\
  \ had been performed.  \n \nIt could not be established why the chief officer, a\
  \ veteran of the sea , and senior officer \non board would have ignore d the warnings\
  \ given by the bosun and enter ed the cargo \nhold, particularly as number 5 cargo\
  \ hold was not one of those identified by the \nfumigator as needing water removed.\
  \  \n \nIt could not be established what training the deceased deck crew member\
  \ had received \nin the hazards of entering closed cargo hold, but he might not\
  \ have been aware of why \nthe chief officer was unconscious, or may simply have\
  \ been overwhelmed by an \nemotional urge to perform the rescue in spite of the\
  \ danger to himself.  \n \n4.5. Survivability  \n4.5.1.  The way in which the crew\
  \ responded to the emergency was indicative of insufficient  \nknowledge and inadequate\
  \  training on board the TPC Wellington .  The response  was unco -\nordinated,\
  \ with  several different parties taking action independent ly of each other until\
  \ the \ngeneral alarm was raised approximately 8 minutes after the event . \n4.5.2.\
  \  When the chief officer collapsed on the cargo hold access ladder , the bosun\
  \ immediately \nshouted  to other members of the crew stationed at the gangway.\
  \  Ideally, someone should \nhave sound ed the general alarm to ensure a co -ordinated\
  \ response, leaving the bosun at the \nscene, who had the most knowledge of what\
  \ had happened, to guard the scene and prevent a \nrepeat occurrence . \n4.5.3.\
  \  The master , on receiving the call , rather than sounding the alarm,  went to\
  \ see what was \nhappening, as did the third  officer.  Owing to a lack of proper\
  \ communication , neither of them \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Report 10 -201 was sure where\
  \ the accident had happened and they went independently to the wrong cargo \nhold\
  \ access.  This further delayed the rescue.  Had the master taken appropriate control\
  \ of the \nsituation, sounded the alarm and contacted the shore authorities before\
  \ going to the scene \nthen the rescue  may well have been expedited.  Whether this\
  \ could have saved the life of \neither of the victims is difficu lt to determine.\
  \  \n4.5.4.  If the response had been instantaneous, and some thought been given\
  \ to placing the second  \nbreathing apparatus on one of the victims in the cargo\
  \ hold, it is remotely possible that one \ncould have been saved.  This would have\
  \ given the resc uers more time to prepare for the \nretrieval in a co -ordinated\
  \ way.  \n4.5.5.  Both breathing apparatus sets were brought to the scene and one\
  \ set was used effectively by \nthe third  officer to recover the chi ef officer.\
  \  The second set proved too bulky for its wearer to \nreach the second  victim.\
  \  The  EEBD  was only meant as an  \u2015escape \u2016 device so the first \nengineer\
  \ using it to enter the hold, while laudable, was considerably risky .  The air\
  \ supply from \nthe EEBD was luckily sufficient for the first engineer  to carry\
  \ out the retrieval  of the deck crew \nmember , but  only just.  The first engineer\
  \ was on the point of collapse as he exited the hold \nand if he  had not been close\
  \ enough to the exit to be hauled clear by hi s colleagues  he to o \ncould have\
  \ become a casualty.  \n \nFinding  \n \nThe rescue response from the vessel's master\
  \ and crew was not well coor dinated or \npractis ed, taking some 15 to 20 minutes\
  \ to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and \nattempt resuscitation.  Given the\
  \ survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue \nattempt would have had\
  \ to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to \nsurviv e, which\
  \ would have been  achievable if the entry into enclosed space s procedure \nhad\
  \ been followed in the first place.  \n \n \n  \nFigure 5 EEBD used in the rescue\
