- safety_issue: 'The rescue response from the vessel''s master and crew was not well coordinated or practised, taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and attempt resuscitation. Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue attempt would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to survive, which would have been achievable if the entry into enclosed spaces procedure had been followed in the first place.
