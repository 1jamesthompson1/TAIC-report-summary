- name: Communication and Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The document indicates that there were communication issues during the emergency response, as the master and third officer went independently to the wrong cargo hold access, which delayed the rescue (4.5.3). However, the initial accident was not directly caused by communication issues but rather by the failure to follow enclosed space entry procedures.
- name: Training and Preparedness for Emergency Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document states that no evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that enclosed space drill or training had been performed (4.4.6, 5.4). This lack of training and preparedness directly contributed to the accident by failing to mitigate the known high-risk of entering enclosed cargo holds containing logs.
- name: Maintenance Procedures and Compliance
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of maintenance procedures and compliance issues contributing to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document highlights that the TPC Wellington's shipboard management manual contained references to the requirements for loading log cargoes and procedures for enclosed space entry, but the ship's Safety and Ship Management (SSM) failed to mitigate the known high-risk to the crew (4.4.5, 4.4.6). This indicates a failure in regulatory compliance and safety management.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The chief officer's decision to enter the cargo hold without taking precautions suggests a lack of situational awareness regarding the dangers of the enclosed space (4.2.2, 4.2.3). However, the document does not provide enough information to determine if situational awareness was a significant factor in the accident.
- name: Equipment Design and Specifications
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'There is no mention of equipment design and specifications contributing to the accident within the provided document. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.

- name: Risk Assessment and Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document indicates that the dangers of organic cargoes such as logs depleting oxygen in enclosed spaces were well-known and documented in the cargo handling procedures on board the TPC Wellington (4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3). However, the risks were not adequately managed, as evidenced by the lack of training and drills for enclosed space entry (4.4.6, 5.4).
- name: Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The document describes the emergency response as uncoordinated and indicative of insufficient knowledge and inadequate training on board the TPC Wellington (4.5.1, 5.7). This lack of planning and coordination significantly impacted the ability to respond effectively to the emergency.
- name: Distracted Operation

- name: Human Error and Error Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The document discusses the chief officer's decision to enter the cargo hold without precautions as a possible knowledge-based mistake (4.2.2, 4.2.5). Additionally, the deck crew member's decision to enter the hold to assist may have been influenced by a strong emotional motivation, indicating human error (4.2.4).
- name: Safety Culture and Organizational Influences
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'While the document suggests issues with safety management, it does not provide specific evidence of a broader safety culture or organizational influence contributing to the accident. Therefore, this theme is not applicable to the accident.
