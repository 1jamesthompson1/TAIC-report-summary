","0.0","10.0","The document indicates that there were communication issues during the emergency response, as the master and third officer went independently to the wrong cargo hold access, which delayed the rescue (4.5.3). However, the initial accident was not directly caused by communication issues but rather by the failure to follow enclosed space entry procedures.
","0.0","21.667","The document states that no evidence could be found in the vessel's records for the previous 3 months that enclosed space drill or training had been performed (4.4.6, 5.4). This lack of training and preparedness directly contributed to the accident by failing to mitigate the known high-risk of entering enclosed cargo holds containing logs.

","0.0","16.667","The document highlights that the TPC Wellington's shipboard management manual contained references to the requirements for loading log cargoes and procedures for enclosed space entry, but the ship's Safety and Ship Management (SSM) failed to mitigate the known high-risk to the crew (4.4.5, 4.4.6). This indicates a failure in regulatory compliance and safety management.
","2.887","5.0","The chief officer's decision to enter the cargo hold without taking precautions suggests a lack of situational awareness regarding the dangers of the enclosed space (4.2.2, 4.2.3).

","0.0","15.0","The document indicates that the dangers of organic cargoes such as logs depleting oxygen in enclosed spaces were well-known and documented in the cargo handling procedures on board the TPC Wellington (4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3). However, the risks were not adequately managed, as evidenced by the lack of training and drills for enclosed space entry (4.4.6, 5.4).
