Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of awareness and adherence to safety procedures: The chief officer entered the enclosed space without checking the atmosphere and without following safety precautions. The crew members may not have received adequate training on the hazards of entering enclosed spaces.
2. Insufficient knowledge and training: The crew's response to the emergency was uncoordinated and lacked proper communication. There was a lack of training and drills specifically for enclosed space rescue on board the vessel.
3. Dangers of log cargos in enclosed spaces: Logs can deplete oxygen and release toxic gases such as CO, CO2, and H2S. The crew members entered the cargo hold without wearing breathing apparatus and were affected by the lack of oxygen and possible presence of toxic gases.
4. Inadequate rescue response: The rescue response was delayed and not efficient. The crew members did not follow proper procedures and did not use the available breathing apparatus effectively.
5. Lack of compliance and oversight: The ship owner and operating company, as well as senior staff on board, have a responsibility to ensure compliance with safety regulations and procedures. In this case, there were deficiencies in compliance and oversight, leading to the high-risk situation.
6. Failure to recognize and address risks: Despite the well-documented risks associated with entering enclosed spaces, the ship's management manual and systems did not adequately address the dangers of enclosed spaces and did not include an enclosed space rescue drill in the emergency response training program.
