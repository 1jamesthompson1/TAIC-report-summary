Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of awareness and adherence to safety procedures: The chief officer entered the enclosed space without checking the atmosphere and without following safety precautions. The crew members may not have received adequate training on the hazards of entering enclosed spaces.
2. Insufficient oxygen and presence of toxic gases: The oxygen levels in the cargo hold were depleted, and toxic gases such as CO, CO2, and H2S may have been present. The crew members were not able to detect the reduced oxygen content or the presence of toxic gases without proper equipment.
3. Inadequate emergency response and coordination: The response to the emergency was uncoordinated, with different parties taking independent actions. The rescue attempt took too long, and there was a lack of proper communication and coordination among the crew members.
