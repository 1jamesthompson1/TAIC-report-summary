The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such  analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.  
 
These reports may be reprinted in whole or in part without charge, providing acknowledgement is made

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is an independent Crown entity 
responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and incidents for New Zealand, and 
co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investiga tion organisations overseas.  The principal 
purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and causes of occurrence with a view to 
avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to ascribe blame to any person or agency 
or to pu rsue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or regulatory action against a person or 
agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing members of the transport sector, both 
domestically and internationally, of the lessons that can be  learnt from transport accidents and 
incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
Summary  
1.1. On the afternoon of 3 May 2010, the bulk log carrier TPC Wellington  was loading logs in Port 
Marsden, Northland. When the chief officer entered a cargo hold that was full of logs that had 
been loaded at  a previous port , he rapidly lost useful consciousness (lost the ability to hold on 
to the ladder) and fell from the ladder onto the cargo below.   
1.2. The ship's bosun had accompanied the chief officer to the cargo hold access and when the 
chief officer fell he alerted nearby deck crew before leaving to collect rescue equipment.  One 
of the nearby crew members went to the hold access and on seeing the unconscious chief 
officer below, entered the hold with the intention of rescuing him.  He too rapidly lost use ful 
consciousness and fell from the ladder onto the cargo below.   
1.3. The 2 crew members lost useful consciousness owing to the combined effects of an oxygen -
depleted atmosphere and the likely presence of toxic gases, both consequences of the organic 
decompos ition of the logs in the closed cargo hold.  The oxygen levels in the cargo hold were 
as low as 1 % to 3%, which would cause loss of effective consciousness within 3 to 9 seconds,  
and total unconsciousness very soon after wards , followed by death within 5 mi nutes.   Both 
crew members were pronounced dead at the scene after they had been rescued from the hold 
access.   
1.4. The dangers of the organic decomposition of logs and other organic cargos in enclosed spaces 
are well known in the international maritime community, and were documented on board the 
TPC Wellington , but in spite of this the high risk this posed to the crew had not been identified, 
no specific training had been given to the crew members to heighten thei r awareness of the 
risk, and no emergency drills had been conducted in recent times for rescue from enclosed 
spaces.  
1.5. The emergency response by the ship's crew to the accident was not well co -ordinated, which 
reduced the possibility of saving the lives of t he 2 men in the cargo hold.  
1.6. Internationally a disproportionately high number of deaths attributable to entry into enclosed 
spaces has prompted a review by the International Maritime Organisation of what can be done 
to improve safety in this area.  The Comm ission has not been able to make any new and 
meaningful recommendations to address this well  known safety issue.  The Commission will , 
however forward this report to the IMO and invite the appropriate committee to note the 
contents of the report for any fu ture program mes to improve awareness of the dangers 
associated with entry into enclosed spaces.  
Key l essons  
 Enclosed (confined) spaces can kill.  
 Never enter an enclosed (confined) space unless you have checked the atmosphere.  
 Always follow the correct proc edures for entering enclosed (confined) spaces.  
 Manuals and written procedures alone will not prevent accidents, but training and 
audit that ensures they are understood and are followed, probably will.

 Report 10 -201 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 3 May 2010 at about 1830,  the Commission were notified by  Maritime New Zealand that 
the accident had occurred at about 1700 the same evening on board the TPC Wellington  while 
berthed at Port Marsden, Northland.  
2.2. The circumstances reported were that the vessel had been loading a car go of logs  and 2 of 
the crew  had died when they entered a cargo hold that was full of logs.  A third crew member 
had nearly succumbed during the attempted rescue of the first 2.  
2.3. As the accident fell into the category of a ―very serious accident‖ as defined  in the IMO's 
casualty investigation code , which requires states to conduct investigation s under the code , 
the Commission opened an inquiry into the occurrence.  
2.4. The Commission contacted the flag state of the vessel, Panama .  The Commission and the 
Panama Maritime Authority agreed that the Commission would investigate the occurrence and 
would produce a report as part of a joint investigation into the occurrence.  Once the final 
report had been produced by the Commission, Pan ama would present the report to the IMO.   
2.5. On 4 May 2010 , an investigator from the Commission travelled from Wellington to Port 
Marsden.  On arrival  the investigator was met and briefed by Maritime New Zealand 
investigators, the New Zealand Police, the Cor oner and a member of the port's management 
team.   That same day the investigator examined the scene of the accident .   
2.6. During the next 2 days the investigator interviewed witnesses who had been involved in the 
rescue and in the events leading up to the acc ident.  Others involved in the operation of the 
vessel were also interviewed.  
2.7. Following the first phase of the investigation data was sourced from national and international 
agencies regarding the carriage of logs and the ir effect on the atmosphere when st owed in 
enclosed spaces.  The Commission  also received the post -mortem autopsy reports for the 2 
deceased crew members.  
2.8. On 24 March  2011 , the Commission approved the circulation of a draft final report to 
interested persons.   
2.9. The draft final report was sent to 16 interested persons with a request that submissions be 
forwarded to the Commission no later than 18 April 2011.  Submissions were received from 
the Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal and the Panama Maritime Authority  and Maritime New 
Zealand .   
2.10.  On 26 May 2011, The Commission approved the publication of the final report

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 26 April 2010 at about 0654, the TPC Wellington  arrived in Napier after a voyage from  
Korea.  The vessel was a 5 -hold ―handy size‖ bulk carrier equipped to carry logs.  The vessel 
commenced loading logs  at about 0900 until about  1830 on 28 April 2010.  The vessel sailed 
for Tauranga at about 1945 that evening.   
3.1.2.  While the vessel was in Napier the vessel's agency stat ement of facts noted that number 5 
cargo h old was worked between 0700 on 27 April and 1830 on 28 April.  The statement of 
facts also noted showers (of rain ) between 1900 on 27 April and 0700 on 28 April.   While in 
Napier the TPC Wellington  loaded a total o f about 13 991 cubic metres (m3) of logs of which 
about 4184 m3 were loaded in number 5  cargo hold.  
3.1.3.  The TPC Wellington  arrived in Tauranga  during the morning of 30 April and car go operations 
commenced at about 0700 .  The vessel's Agency statement of facts noted that cargo was 
worked in number 5 cargo hold from 0700 on 30 April  until about 1530 on 1 May  when 
number 5 cargo hold was full and the hatch lids were closed .  Cargo work continued until 
2200 on 1 May.  The weather was reported as being fine througho ut the vessel's stay in 
Tauranga.  While in Tauranga the TPC Wellington  loaded a total of about 13  091 m3 of logs , of 
which about 963 m3 were loaded in number 5 cargo hold and 2369 m3 of logs were loaded on 
the deck at number 5 cargo hatch.   
3.1.4.  On the morning of 2 May 2010, t he TPC Wellington  sailed from Tauranga for Port Marsden 
and arrived in P ort Marsden in the evening of  the same day.  Cargo operations commenced at 
about 2200 on 2 May 2010.  The vessel was due to load about 11  476 m3 of logs none of 
them  being loaded at number 5 cargo hatch.   
3.1.5.  The logs were to be fumigated on passage to China.  On 3 May  at about 1530, the Marsden 
fumigation supervisor for a fumigation company and a work colleague boarded the vessel to 
carry out a pre -inspection of the cargo holds and ship to ensure that the ship was compliant 
for the on-voyage fumigation and there were  no health and safety issues for the crew.   
3.1.6.  At about 1640 , the Marsden fumigation supervisor  and the work colleague report ed to the 
master  on the results of the fumigation pre -inspection.  The Marsden fumigation supervisor  
reported that:  
Hatches 3F, 4F, 2F and 1F had excessive amounts of water visible in them which 
needed to be removed before fumigation could take place.  Also the [rubber] seal 
on No .5 aft access door needed to be replaced.   
3.1.7.  The master called the chief officer to his cabin and a discussion followed on what could be 
done to remove the moisture from the hatches.  The master then spoke to the chief officer in 
their native tongue (Korean ), after which the chief officer left the master's cabin.  The master 
later said that  he: 
… didn't know where  he [the chief officer]  was going or what he [the chief officer] 
was planning to do.  We hadn't made any decisions, and I hadn't given him any 
orders.  
3.1.8.  The chief officer was next seen at the port gangway station by some  crew members .  The chief 
officer asked  the bosun, who was assisting with adjusting the gangway, to go with him to 
number 5 cargo hold access , which was located nearby on the forwar d face of the 
accommodation block  (see Figure 1) . 
3.1.9.  The bosun followed the chief officer towards the aft acce ss door for number 5 cargo hold .  The 
bosun said that o n the way to the hold access he asked the chief officer what they were doing.  
The bosun said later that the chief officer replied that he wanted to go down the hold as there 
was water in the cargo hold;  the bosun said he asked him twice not to go down because ―the 
smell was no good‖.

 3.1.10.  The chief officer and bosun opened the access hatch, then  the chief officer took his torch and 
climbed on  to the ladder to make his way down into the hold.  The bosun said that the chief 
officer said ― OK, no problem‖ and started to descend.  The bosun made an attempt to follow 
him into the hold but after the chief officer had descended only a short distance, estimated to 
be about 5 or 6 steps down the ladder he fell onto the logs below that were protrudin g into the 
access way.   
3.1.11.  The bosun immediately shout ed for help from the crew members at the gangway (see Figure 
1) that the chief officer had fallen down the hold.   Once he had got the attention of the crew at 
the gangway the bosun made his way to the aft  mooring station to get a rope suitable for 
hauling the chief officer out of the hold access.   
Rescue phase  
3.1.12.  The second officer , who was at the gangway, on hearing the bosun's shouts for help alerted 
the captain by using his portable radio transceiver.  One of the deck crew  at the gangway ran 
into the accommodation to raise the alarm  verbally .  The third officer who was working in the 
ship's office heard the deck crew member  shouting the alarm , and tried to follow him to the 
accident site ; however, the crew member  had disappeared from view , so the third officer 
made his way to the main deck and went to the port side of number 4 cargo hatch as he was 
unsure where the accident had occurred . 
3.1.13.  The bosun, after finding a rope suitable for the rescue, returned to number 5 cargo hold aft 
access.  When he got there he found that the crew member (who had s houted into the 
accommodation)  was already climbing down the access trunk into the hold and another crew 
member  was about to follow him.  The bosun managed to grab the latter  by the collar and 
pulled him back from the access and told him not to go down.  J ust after the bosun had pulled

 Report 10 -201 the crew member  away from the access he heard the sound of the other crew member  falling  
down the access .  The bosun then looked down the access and saw him lying on top of the 
chief officer in what appeared to be an unconsci ous state.   
3.1.14.  The master on receiving the ra dio message from the second officer left his cabin and went to 
the main deck to see what had happened. He went first to the starboard side of number 4 
cargo hatch but , not finding anyone there he went to the port side where he met the third 
officer.  On their way back to the accommodation they both heard over the radio from the 
second officer that the accident had occurred at number 5 cargo hold  aft access .  The master 
and third officer then made their way there . 
3.1.15.  When t he master and third officer arrived at the scene  they found  the bosun and a crew 
member  looking down into the access .  The master looked down the access hatch and could 
see 2 bodies lying over the logs below.  The master then instructed the third  officer to bring  
the breathing apparatus to the accident scene  and for  the bosun and crew member to raise 
the al arm.   
3.1.16.  The second  officer after alerting the master went to the emergency equipment locker (see 
Figure 1) on the main deck, retrieved a br eathing apparatus set and took it to the accident 
scene.  The third  officer arrived at  the emergency equipment locker  and took another  
breathing apparatus set to the accident scene.  The second  officer then made his way to the 
ship's hospital where he readied the oxygen therapy set for use an d then took it to the 
accident scene .   
3.1.17.  The master then made his way back to his cabin where he informed the Marsden fumigation 
supervisor  of the accident , then to the wheelhouse , stopping on the way to inform the chief 
engineer of the accident.  On arrival in the wheelhouse the master activated the general 
emergency alarm to muster the vessel's crew.   
3.1.18.  The Marsden fumigation supervisor  called the emergency services on his mobile t elephone 
and asked for an ambulance.  He then telephoned the staff at Port Marsden security gate 
house to advise them of the accident and requested that they also telephoned the ambulance 
service to confirm the message and details of accessing the Port Mar sden wharves.  The staff 
at Port Marsden security gate house also telephoned the Marsden Point refinery emergency 
services and requested their assistance.  After making his telephone calls the Marsden

<< Page 7 >>
 fumigation supervisor  and his colleague went to the mai n deck to see what assistance they 
could render.   
3.1.19.  At about 1701, the Police Northern Communications Centre logged the call from the Marsden 
fumigation supervisor  and routed his call to the St. John Ambulance Service.  The St John 
Ambulance Service assigne d the first unit at about 1705 and the ambulance was en  route 
from Whangarei at 1707.  The St. John Ambulance Service notified the Fire Service at about 
1706 and the Police Northern Nommunications  Centre  at about 1707 .  The Fire Service 
alerted its station  at Ruakaka at about 1707 and the first appliance was enroute  at about 
1711.  The St John Ambulance Service requested the Police to attend at about 1713 when it 
had established from its telephone conversation with the Marsden fumigation supervisor that 
one of the ―patients‖ was not breathing. T he Police dispatched its first unit, which was the 
Waipu Police unit, at about 1716.   
3.1.20.  The third  officer on arrival back at the number 5 cargo hold aft access donned one of the 
breathing apparatus sets  and tied the rescue rope  the bosun had found around his waist.  He 
then entered the access and climbed own the ladder to where the chief officer and crew 
member were lying.  He initially tried to tie the rope around the crew member , but the body 
slipp ed further down and under a log;  so the third  officer tied the rope around the chief officer .  
The crew members on the deck then started to haul the chief officer out of the access as the 
third  officer pushed from below.   
3.1.21.  When the chief officer was hauled out of the hold access the crew members took him to the 
starboard side of the vessel where the Marsden fumigation Supervisor  comme nced 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation .  The third  officer on exiting the access was too exhausted to 
return and attempt to rescue the crew member  so removed his breathing apparatus.    
3.1.22.  The first engineer on hearing the general emergency alarm started to make h is way to his 
emergency station in the engine room , but on his way there he heard people on the starboard 
side of the upper deck, so he went to investigate.  That was about the time the chief officer

 Report 10 -201 was hauled out.  When the first engineer heard that one other crew member was still trapped 
in the hold he donned the other breathing apparatus and entered the access.   But the 
breathing apparatus prevented him mano euvring  past a log that w as protruding into the 
access.  The first engineer exited the hold and t ook off the breathing apparatus , then  found 
and donned an emergency escape breathing device2 (EEBD) that was of smaller dimensions.    
3.1.23.  The first engineer then re -entered the hold access and climbed down to the crew member .  
When  he got to him  he noted wha t he thought were signs of life , so he took off his EEBD mask 
and placed it momentarily on the unconscious crew member in an attempt to revive him .  The 
first engineer  then replaced his mask and managed to manoeuvre the crew member  out from 
where he had slip ped and attach the rescue rope to him.  The crew members on deck then 
hauled the crew member  out of the access as the first engineer pushed from below.  When  the 
first engineer was nearing the top of the access ladder he started to run out of compressed ai r 
in the EEBD , but was able to be hauled from the access by the crew on deck.  W hen he 
reached the upper deck at about 1737, he was suffering from and showing the signs of 
asphyxia.    
3.1.24.  At about 1716, the first ambulance arrived at Port Marsden and its crew were on  board the 
vessel by about 1719.  The first ambulance was joined within minutes by the Marsden Point 
refinery emergency services, 2 fire appliances from Ruakaka and a Police unit.   
3.1.25.  The a mbulance staff tried to  resuscitat e the chief officer and the crew member , however both 
the chief officer and crew member  were  pronounced dead at the scene.  T he ambulance staff 
also administered oxygen to the first engineer .  Meanwhile  a further ambulance, Police unit, 
fire appliance and 2 fire command units  had arrived at the scene .  Owing  to the condition of 
the first engineer and the distance to the nearest hospital an emergency medical evacuation 
helicopter was used to transport the first engineer to hospital in Whangarei .  The first engineer 
was discharg ed from hospital later that evening and returned to the vessel.   
Testing of hold access atmosphere  
3.1.26.  At about 2215  on the day of the accident , the atmosphere in number 5 hold access was 
tested by a member of the Marsden Point refinery operations team in the  presence of 2 
Maritime New Zealand i nvestigators.  The Marsden Point r efinery employee was using a ITX 
gas monitor , which had been calibrated on 22 April 2010 and was valid until 21 July 2010 , in 
preference to the vessel's oxygen meter .  A normal reading is 20.95% oxygen by volume in the 
atmosphere ; the alarm on the monitor sounds at 19% oxygen in the atmosphere.  T he results 
were as shown:

The access door was then closed and was not opened until the next day , when at 1435 the 
door was reopened and the atmosphere t ested again by a Marsden Po int refinery employee in 
the presen ce of the Maritime New Zealand i nvestigators and the Commission 's investigator . 
The results were as follows:

Time of useful consciousness under reduced inspired oxygen c onditions  
3.1.27.  Time of useful consciousness is defined as the amount of time in which an individual is able to 
perform flying  duties efficiently in an environment of inadequate oxygen  supply  (Dehart & 
Davis, 2002) .  It is the period of time from the interruption of the oxygen supply or exposure to 
an oxygen -poor environment to the time when useful function is lost, and the individual is no 
longer capable of taking proper corrective and protective action. It is not the time to total 
unconsci ousness . The time of useful consciousness  was also known as  effective performance 
time (Wikipedia) .

3.2. Vessel i nformation  
3.2.1.  The TPC Wellington  was built by the Oshima Shipbuilding Company Limited of Nagasaki, Japan  
in 1990.  The vessel was owned by Wellington Maritime S.A. of Panama City, Republic of 
Panama and operated by TPC Korea Company Limited of Seoul Korea.  The vessel was 
registered in Panama and had valid certificates issued by the Panamanian Government and by 
Korean Register classification society  
3.2.2.  The TPC Wellington  was a steel hulled bulk carrier with an overall length of 179.99  m and a 
breadth of 30.50  m.  The vessel had an international gross registered tonnage of 23  257.   
3.2.3.  The vessel's cargo carrying spaces  were divided into 5 holds .  Number 5 hold had a capacity 
of about 9,822 m3 and the other 4 holds had capacities ranging between 8830 m3 and 
11 344 m3 giving a total capacity of about 52  145 m3.  Each cargo hold was covered by 
segmented steel hatch c overs.  When closed the hatch covers  provided a weathertight 
covering to the cargo hold .   
3.2.4.  The cargo holds were capable of being naturally ventilated by vents  located at the forward and 
aft ends of the cargo holds.  These vents were capable of being sealed  shut by a hinged metal 
cover s with rubber sealing strip s attached to the outside s of the vent s.   
3.2.5.  With the exception of number 1 cargo hold , which only had one access,  each cargo hold could 
be entered via 2 fixed arrangements from the weather deck.  One w as to use a vertical ladder 
mounted either in a recess of the corrugated bulkhead or in a n enclosed  trunk.  The second 
was to use a fixed steep spiral staircase with platforms usually located at the opposite end of 

<< Page 10 >>
 Report 10 -201 the hold from the vertical ladder.  Each hold access was covered by a n access lid or dog ged 
door  that could be sealed weathertight  using dogs3.   
3.2.6.  The TPC Wellington  was equipped with the standard range of navigational equipment.  As an 
internationally trading vessel the TPC Wellington  was required to comply with the provisions of 
the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 as modified by the protocol of 
1998 (SOLAS) with regard to fire and life -saving appliances.    
3.3. Personnel information  
3.3.1.  The master of the TPC Welling ton was a 50 -year-old Korean male.  He had been a master for 
about 4 years and had sailed on a variety of vessels. He had been master on board the TPC 
Wellington  for the previous 5 months.  
3.3.2.  The chief officer of the TPC Wellington  was a 56 -year-old Korean ma le.  He had been chief 
officer for several years and was experienced in the carriage of bulk cargoes including logs.  
He had been on board the vessel for about one month.  
3.3.3.  The chief officer's work hours for the previous 3 days were obtained from the compute r 
records on  the vessel , which showed that he had worked the following:

work commenced at 2200 on 2 May then approximately 8 hours from 0800 on the morning of 
3 May until 1700 , the approximate time of t he accident allowing for breaks.   
3.3.4.  The first engineer of the TPC Wellington  was 35 -year-old Korean male.  He had been on board 
the vessel for about 2.5 months.  He had sailed on a variety of  vessels for about 6 and a half 
years .   
3.3.5.  The third  officer of the TPC Wellington  was a 23 -year-old Korean male .  He had been on board 
the vessel for about 5 months.  The TPC Wellington  was his first appointment at sea.    
3.3.6.  The bosun of the TPC Wellington  was a 46 -year-old Myanma r male .  He had been on board the 
vessel for about one month.  He had first gone  to sea in 1998 and had sailed on a variety of 
vessels .   
3.3.7.  The a ble bodied seaman who died  was a 33 -year-old Myanma r male .  He had been on board 
the vessel for about 5 months.  He had served as a seaman at sea for several years.   
3.3.8.  The deceased  seaman 's work hours for the previous 3 days were obtained from the vessel 's 
computer records  which showed that he had worked the foll owing:

3.4. Injuries  
3.4.1.  The autopsy report found that the cause of the chief o fficer's death was  consistent with 
asphyxia due to oxygen deprivation.  The autopsy report found that the chief officer was 
suffering from focal atherosc lerosis of the coronary arteries which may have increased his 
vulnerability to hypoxia.  A toxicological examination revealed no findings of significance.    
3.4.2.  The autopsy report for t he deceased  seaman  found that the cause of his death was consistent 
with asphyxia due to presumed oxygen deprivation.  A toxicological examination revealed a 
blood alcohol content of 32 milligrams per 100 millilitres which equates to about 40% of the 
legal blood alcohol limit for a New Zealand driver 2 0 years or over.   
3.4.3.  The first engineer suffered from mild h ypoxia and was taken to Whangarei Hospital for 
treatment but was released later the same evening.   
3.5. Organisational and management information  
3.5.1.  In 1993, after some fine tuning of the system, the IMO adopted the International Management 
Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code); and in 1998 the 
ISM Code became mandatory.  The ISM Code established safety manage ment objectives and 
required a safety management system ( SMS ) to be established by the company, which was 
defined as the ship owner or any person, such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who had 
assumed responsibility for operating a vessel.  The company was then required to establish 
and implement a policy for achieving these objectives, including providing the necessary 
resources and shore -based support.  The procedures required by the ISM Code were to be 
documented and compiled in a safety management manual, a copy of which was to be kept 
on board.   
3.5.2.  TPC Korea  Company Limited , the o perator  of the TPC Wellington , was audited by Class KR 
under the authority of the Government of the Republic of Panama and was found to comply 
with the requirements of the ISM Code.  The owner was issued with a document of compliance  
certificate, which was renewed, after verification of continued compliance, at regular intervals.   
3.5.3.  On 14 September 2008, the TPC Wellington  had been audited and the vessel's SMS had been 
found to comply with the requirements of the ISM Code.  The vessel had been  issued with a 
safety management certificate on 14 September 2008, which remained valid, subject to 
periodic verification, until 13 September 2013.   
3.5.4.  A part of the ship's SMS  on board was the vessel procedures manual in which the operating 
company laid out the procedures to be followed to operate the vessel. The manual was broken 
down into eight sections namely:  
 shipboard duties  
 shipboard training and drills  
 navigation managem ent 

<< Page 12 >>
 Report 10 -201 
 shipboard safety work  
 environmental protection  
 shipboard maintenance  
 ship operation,  
 cargo Handling  
Shipboard duties included the duties and responsibilities of the master and crew , including 
the chief officer.  Shipboard safety work included referenc e to enclosed space work, the 
personal protective equipment required should emergency entry into an enclosed space be 
required, and an entire chapter on the procedure for enclosed space entry  (see Appendix 3) .  
Section  one of the ship operation manual included a requirement for the master to ensure 
that cargo information was obtained, in accordance with the IMO's Code of Safe Practice for 
Solid Bulk Cargoes ( BC Code), including any hazard that might  occur from the transportation of 
the cargo and the man agement of dangerous cargoes.  Cargo handling included a chapter on 
log handling.   
3.6. Cargo information and properties  
3.6.1.  The TPC Wellington  was chartered to transport logs, predominantly Monterey p ine ( Pinus 
radiata ) from New Zealand to Korea and China.   
3.6.2.  The carriage of logs at sea and in bulk was covered in the IMO's BC Code which was first 
published in 1965.  The C ode ha d been revised and republished several times since then.   
3.6.3.  Section 3 of the BC C ode was concerned with the safety of personnel and ship s and gave  
general information on the safety precautions to be taken and information to be passed to the 
master before the commenc ement of loading (see Appendix 1 ).  Section 3 also referred  to the 
general precautions to be taken when an enclosed space  was enter ed which were contained 
in Appendix 7 of the BC C ode (see Appendix 2 ).  Paragraph 3.2.4 of the BC C ode specifically 
mentioned timber logs and stated:  
3.2.4 Many cargoes frequently carried in bulk are liable to cause oxygen 
depletion in a cargo  space or tan k; these include most vegetable products, 
grains, timber logs and forest products,  ferrous metals, metal sulphide 
concentrates and coal cargoes.  
3.6.4.  Organic materials are subject to decomposition over time , principally due to either 
microbiological (an aerobic or aerobic) or autoxidative processes.  Various gaseous products 
are then formed , including carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrogen sulphide 
(H2S) and hydrocarbons.  When organic materials are stored in confined spaces, these 
decomposit ion products will accumulate in the air and may eventually reach toxic level s.  
Oxygen depletion will occur  simultaneously (Urban Svendberg, 2009) .   
3.6.5.  The deck cargo was destined for Korea and was to be fumigated at a shore -base d facility in 
Korea after discharge from the ship.  The cargo in the holds was destined for China and was to 
be fumigated during the sea passage between New Zealand and Korea.   
3.6.6.  Fumigating  the holds required the holds to be sealed as airtight as possible a nd a fumigant to 
be introduced into the holds by a suitably qualified person , who would then ensure that a 
sufficiently high concentration of the fumigant was contained within the hold for a sufficient 
period to achieve the desired result.   
3.6.7.  Fumigation of cargo was conducted under the Recommendations for the safe use of 
pesticides in ships produced by the IMO in circular MSC.1/Circ.1358 which stated in its 
introduction:  
… Account has been taken of existing recommendations of the World Health 
Orga nization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in regard to pesticide 
residues and occupational safety.  
3.6.8.  The Marsden fumigation s upervisor  for the fumigation company was on  board the vessel to 
ensure that the ship was fit to be fumigated and to provide documentation and explanation to 
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 13 >>
 the master on the fumigant to be used, the hazards involved and the precautions to be taken .  
The colleague who accompanied him was to travel with the ship  to conduct the fumigation .   
3.6.9.  The fu migant that was to be used was p hosphine gas (PH 3) which  was introduced int o the 
cargo holds as Aluminium p hosph ide in pellet form.  Aluminium p hosphide re acted 
exothermically4 with water sufficiently that it w as possible to ignite the cargo, which was why 
the supervisor  commented on the amount of water in the holds .  His task  was to inspect the 
ship and to provide the master with a gas suitability statement  detailing areas that  required 
sealing or other remedial works to ensure that the vessel was suitable for in -transit 
fumigation.  If the vessel was found to be unsuitable or not capable  of being made suitable  
during the loading period the f umigator -in-charge would recommend re jection of the vessel.  
The Marsden fumigation s upervisor  was in the process of filling out the gas suitability 
statement with the master when the accident happened.

 Report 10 -201 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction to the issues  
4.1.1.  Death by entry into enclosed spaces on ships is not  a new phenomenon; in fact for decades it 
has been one of the most talked -about and well documented risks facing crews in the 
maritime industry.  
4.1.2.  The Commission now discusses  why the 2 crew members died in this case, the inherent 
dangers created by the carr iage of log cargoes at sea, and the procedures that should have 
been followed to avoid the 2 deaths in this case.  
4.1.3.  Also discussed are the survivability aspects of this accident; that is, could the 2 crew members 
have been saved? It is not the purpose of thi s report to ascribe blame, but sometimes that 
inference is unavoidable if the lessons are to be learned.  Without detracting from the sincere 
efforts some crew members ma de to save the 2 colleagues collapsed in the hold, some 
important lessons are discusse d that could benefit other mariners reading this report.  
4.2. Why the crew members died  
4.2.1.  The accident sequence started when the chief officer entered an enclosed cargo space 
without checking that the atmosphere was suitable for entry and without following the 
appropriate safety precautions.  In this case, there was insufficient oxygen in the hold to 
sustain life for more than a few minutes.  The presence of other toxic gases such as CO and 
H2S would of themselves have been  likely to cause similar incapacitation t hrough intoxication.  
However, the effects of such severe hypoxia would be supervening in a short time period.  
With such a rapid onset of loss of useful consciousness, the crew would have been unlikely to 
recognise the effect s of hypoxia in time to self -rescue from the oxygen -depleted area.  
4.2.2.  The Commission was unable to determine why the chief officer who was second in command 
on the vessel, had sailed on bulk carriers carrying logs often during his career, was considered 
by his peers to be a competent offi cer and in part was responsible for the safe working 
practices of the deck crew, would enter an enclosed space without taking well  documented 
precautions.  
4.2.3.  Ironically number 5 cargo hold was not one mentioned by the master as having excess water 
in it, so t here was no purpose for his going down there.  The master did refer to the rubber 
seal on number 5 hold access door needing replacing, but this should have been easily 
checked from the deck.  It is possible that he mixed up the tasks associated with each c argo 
hold.  Delays for ships engaged in any kind of charter can be costly , so the possibility that the 
ship w ould be rejected as suitable for in -transit fumigation would have been a strong driver to 
remedy the problems identified by the fumigation provider , possibly at the expense of taking 
appropriate precautions.  
4.2.4.  The reasons for the deck crew member choosing  to enter the enclosed space are easier to 
rationalise.  He was not at the access door when the chief officer entered the cargo hold, but 
only heard t he bosun shout that the chief officer had fallen.  The deck crew member then 
entered the accommodation to raise the alarm before proceeding to the access.  The deck 
crew member might not necessarily have been aware that the chief officer had collapsed from  
asphyxiation , a possible slip/trip/fall scenario being quite feasible.  On arrival at the hold 
access there was nobody else there, the bosun having gone to get a rescue line.  Like the 
chief officer, it could not be established what training the deck crew  member had received for 
entry into enclosed spaces filled with log cargos, so it could not be ruled out that his action to 
help the chief officer was a knowledge -based mistake, one possibly heavily influenced by a 
strong emotional motivation to assist a c olleague, so close and visibly in obvious distress.  
4.2.5.  In 1990, James Reason in his book Human Error distinguished between 3 main groups of 
error, namely slips, lapses and mistakes.  He described knowledge -based mistakes as:  
Knowledge -based thinking involves evaluating an unfamiliar or unusual situation 
and deciding on a course of action.  Ideally, operational personnel would make 
decisions by following a carefully reasoned process involving considering all the 
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 15 >>
 options and wei ghing up the risks of various courses of action.  In reality 
however, things are not that simple.  Sometimes we do not consider all of the 
alternatives or we take mental short cuts to arrive at a solution.  Or under the 
pressure of having too little time a nd too much to do, thinking becomes ―short 
circuited‖ and we end up deciding on an unsuitable course of action. Emotional 
factors also exert a powerful influence on decisions, and despite the most 
thorough training, no one is immune to such pressures (Reason, 1990) .   
The scenario where the rescuer has succumbed to the same fate as the person being rescued 
has been all too common in the maritime industry, and there are many examples of this 
included in the IMO statistics, which are discussed in more detail below.  
 
Finding  
 
According to the autopsy reports , the chief officer and  the deck crew member died from 
asphyxia due to oxygen deprivation, which  was consistent with the depleted (about 3%) 
level of oxygen in the cargo hold they had entered immediately before collapsing.  
 
4.3. Dangers created by log cargos in enclosed spaces  
4.3.1.  In 2009, total log exports from New Zealand were provisionally recorded as being in excess of 
9 million m3 of which over 50 % was destined for China (DANA Limited, 2010) .  To transport 
this amount of logs would require more than  200 shipments on vessels of a similar size to the 
TPC Wellington .  No record could be found in the previous  10 years of a similar occurrence 
happening in a New Zealand port.  
4.3.2.  Organic cargoes such as logs were known to deplete oxygen in enclosed atmosphere s.  The 
depleted oxygen is often replaced by other gases injurious to the health, or fatal in sufficient 
quant ities, such as CO, CO 2, H2S and h ydrocarbons  (Urban Svendberg, 2009) .  CO and CO 2 are 
colourless and odourless.  H2S is colourless and , although known as the ―rotten egg smell‖ at 
concentrations over 100  parts per million  causes paralysis of the olfactory nerve and thus 
seems to be odourless and is extremely toxic (Lewis, 1996) .  The main hydrocarbon emitted by 
logs as they decompose is a monoterpene, α -pinene, which would have accounted for th e 
strong pine smell in the hold.  The chief officer would not have been able to detect the 
presence of 3 of the toxic gases produced by the logs , but would have been able to smell the 
presence of the monoterpene.  He would also have been unable to detect, without the aid of 
an oxygen meter, the reduced oxygen content of the atmosphere within the hold.  His first 
indication that something was ―wrong‖ would have been as he started to succumb to the lack 
of oxygen and the possible presence of the other toxic g ases, which as discussed above would 
have happened rapidly.  
4.3.3.  The organic cargo, logs, in cargo hold number 5 had depleted the amount of oxygen available 
in the access trunk to the hold, as measured after the event, to such a degree that anyone 
entering the hold without wearing breathing apparatus would have been affected virtually as 
soon as they entered the hold.  The Occupational Health and Safety Administration in the 
United States of America has a standard of 20.8 % to 21.0 % as the normal oxygen level in  the 
atmosphere , and 19.5% or below is considered a low oxygen level.  The National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health in the United States of America produced a technical report on 
respiratory protection that noted the following signs and sympto ms were observable when a 
human body experienced oxygen deficiency  (see below) :  
  

<< Page 16 >>
 Report 10 -201 Oxygen % in atmosphere  Symptoms  
16% to 12%  Deep breathing, accelerated heartbeat, impaired attention, 
impaired thinking, impaired coordination.  
12% to 10%  Very faulty judg ment, very poor coordination, rapid fatigue 
from exertion that may cause permanent heart damage, 
intermittent breathing.  
10% and below  Nausea, vomiting, inability to perform vigorous movement or 
loss of all movement, unconsciousness followed by death.  
Less than 6%  Spasmodic breathing, convulsive movements, death in 
minutes.  
Table 6  
Observable symptoms of oxygen deprivation on the human body  
4.3.4.  The initial reading of 1% at the second rung down could have been representative of the hold 
access atmosphere before the exterior atmosphere mixed with it, hence the reading at the 
third rung down some 15 minutes later being 2%.  
4.3.5.  Similar tests conducted the following day showed a level of 3% at a depth of 3 m into the hold.  
The time of usefu l consciousness at this level would have been in the range of 9 to 12 
seconds from the time of inhaling air at between 1% and 3%, this time being the average time 
for oxygen de -saturated air to circulate to the brain.  After 9 to 12 seconds the chief offic er 
and the deck crew member would have become rapidly confused, poorly co -ordinated and 
unable to hold on  to the ladder, so falling to the logs below.  Complete loss of consciousness 
would have followed rapidly, and death within 5 minutes.  The range of 1 % to 3 % therefore 
was critically low and could not sustain life for more than a few minutes.  
 
Findings  
 
On entering the cargo hold with a 3% level of oxygen, the chief officer and deck crew 
member would have had 9 to 12 seconds of useful consciousness to maintain a hold on 
the access ladder; total unconsciousness rapidly following and death within 5 minutes.  
 
Oxygen levels in the cargo hold would have been depleted by the organic decomposition 
of the logs and toxic gases such as CO, CO2 and H2S may also have been present, 
phenomena well know n to the shipping industry and one that were  documented in the 
cargo handling procedures on board the TPC Wellington . 
 
4.4. Entry into enclosed spaces  
4.4.1.  An enclosed space was defined by the IMO as being a space that had  any of the following 
characteristics; limited openings for entry and exit, unfavourable natural ventilation, and not 
being designed for continuous worker occupancy.  Enclosed spaces on ships such as cargo 
holds, fuel and ballast tanks, void spaces, a nd cofferdams had been a source of accidents 
and increased scrutiny by regulatory and safety authorities.   
4.4.2.  In 1997 the IMO introduced recommendations for entering enclosed spaces and these 
superseded the recommendations already contained in Appendix F to the bulk carrier code, 
which later became Appendix 7 of the bulk carrier code that was current at the time of the 
accident.   
4.4.3.  Despite the introduction of the recommendations on entry into enclosed spaces by the IMO in 
1997, accidents continued to happen an d became a subject of concern to the Marine 
Accident Investigators International Forum (MAIIF) .  In 2009 it submitted a document to the 
IMO calling for a revision of the procedures and citing at least 101 enclosed space incidents 
resulting in 93 deaths and  96 injuries since the recommendations had been  adopted (Marine 
Accident Investigator's International Forum, 2009) .  In 2009, Maritime NZ issued Safety 
Bulletin Issue 21 - September 2009, Enclosed and Confined S paces Can Kill highlighting to 
the maritime industry the dangers of enclosed spaces (see Appendix 4).   
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 17 >>
 4.4.4.  Having rules, regulations and guidelines does not in itself ensure compliance with them, nor 
does simply repeating the rules  and regulations in on -board documentation ensure 
compliance.  The responsibility for ensuring compliance with legislation and company 
operating procedures firstly rests with the ship owner or operating company, then with senior 
staff on board who have the res ponsibility for ensuring compliance on board, then lastly with 
the crew who are performing the procedure.  It is this chain of responsibility that is espous ed 
in the ISM Code, and if the chain is broken in some way the crew who are most likely to 
encounter  an enclosed space scenario are at higher risk of having an accident.   
4.4.5.  The TPC Wellington 's shipboard management manual and systems had been audited and 
approved by Korean Register under the ISM Code.  The manual contained references to the 
requirements to  be followed when loading log cargoes, the dangers associated with the cargo 
and procedures to be taken if entry into an enclosed space was required.  However, TPC Korea 
Company Limited , although identifying the need for education and training onboard for 
emergency response training and drills in the vessel procedures manual had not identified the 
need for an enclosed space rescue drill in the ship's emergency response drill matrix.  
4.4.6.  The SSM  failed to mitigate what was known to be a high-risk to the crew.  N o record could be 
found of specific training for the crew to highlight the danger of entering enclosed cargo holds, 
nor had an enclosed space drill been held.  Of the crew who had been made aware of the 
dangers, this awareness stemmed from shore -based trai ning or training with other operator s. 
4.4.7.  The bosun asked the chief officer twice not to enter the hold because he knew of the dangers.  
As previously mentioned , the Commission was unable to determine what training  the chief 
officer had received;  however, as the second most senior officer on board the vessel he 
should have been aware of the requirements on enclosed space entry and these would have 
been included in his certificated training (International Maritime Organization, 2005) .   
 
Finding s 
 
Being a dedicated log carrier , the risk of death by entering closed cargo holds containing 
logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency 
response training program me, yet no evidence could be found in the  vessel's records for 
the previous 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed.  
 
It could not be established why the chief officer, a veteran of the sea , and senior officer 
on board would have ignore d the warnings given by the bosun and enter ed the cargo 
hold, particularly as number 5 cargo hold was not one of those identified by the 
fumigator as needing water removed.  
 
It could not be established what training the deceased deck crew member had received 
in the hazards of entering closed cargo hold, but he might not have been aware of why 
the chief officer was unconscious, or may simply have been overwhelmed by an 
emotional urge to perform the rescue in spite of the danger to himself.  
 
4.5. Survivability  
4.5.1.  The way in which the crew responded to the emergency was indicative of insufficient  
knowledge and inadequate  training on board the TPC Wellington .  The response  was unco -
ordinated, with  several different parties taking action independent ly of each other until the 
general alarm was raised approximately 8 minutes after the event . 
4.5.2.  When the chief officer collapsed on the cargo hold access ladder , the bosun immediately 
shouted  to other members of the crew stationed at the gangway.  Ideally, someone should 
have sound ed the general alarm to ensure a co -ordinated response, leaving the bosun at the 
scene, who had the most knowledge of what had happened, to guard the scene and prevent a 
repeat occurrence . 
4.5.3.  The master , on receiving the call , rather than sounding the alarm,  went to see what was 
happening, as did the third  officer.  Owing to a lack of proper communication , neither of them 

<< Page 18 >>
 Report 10 -201 was sure where the accident had happened and they went independently to the wrong cargo 
hold access.  This further delayed the rescue.  Had the master taken appropriate control of the 
situation, sounded the alarm and contacted the shore authorities before going to the scene 
then the rescue  may well have been expedited.  Whether this could have saved the life of 
either of the victims is difficu lt to determine.  
4.5.4.  If the response had been instantaneous, and some thought been given to placing the second  
breathing apparatus on one of the victims in the cargo hold, it is remotely possible that one 
could have been saved.  This would have given the resc uers more time to prepare for the 
retrieval in a co -ordinated way.  
4.5.5.  Both breathing apparatus sets were brought to the scene and one set was used effectively by 
the third  officer to recover the chi ef officer.  The second set proved too bulky for its wearer to 
reach the second  victim.  The  EEBD  was only meant as an  ―escape ‖ device so the first 
engineer using it to enter the hold, while laudable, was considerably risky .  The air supply from 
the EEBD was luckily sufficient for the first engineer  to carry out the retrieval  of the deck crew 
member , but  only just.  The first engineer was on the point of collapse as he exited the hold 
and if he  had not been close enough to the exit to be hauled clear by hi s colleagues  he to o 
could have become a casualty.  
 
Finding  
 
The rescue response from the vessel's master and crew was not well coor dinated or 
practis ed, taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and 
attempt resuscitation.  Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue 
attempt would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to 
surviv e, which would have been  achievable if the entry into enclosed space s procedure 
had been followed in the first place.

 5. Findings  
The following findings are not listed in any order of priority:  
5.1. According to the autopsy reports the chief officer and the d eck crew member died from 
asphyxia due to oxygen deprivation, which  was consistent with the depleted (about 3%) level 
of oxygen in the cargo hold they had entered immediately before collapsing.  
5.2. On entering the cargo hold with a 3% level of oxygen, the chie f officer and deck crew member 
would have had 9 to 12 seconds of useful consciousness to maintain a hold on the access 
ladder; total unconsciousness rapidly following and death within 5 minutes.  
5.3. Oxygen levels in the cargo hold would have been depleted by o rganic decomposition of the 
logs and toxic gases such as CO, CO2 and H2S may also have been present, phenomena well -
known to the shipping industry and one s that w ere documented in the cargo -handling 
procedures on board the TPC Wellington  
5.4. Being a dedicated log carrier the risk of death by entering enclosed cargo holds containing 
logs and rescue from enclosed spaces should have been high on the ship's emergency 
response training program me, yet no evidence could be found in the vessel 's records for the 
previou s 3 months that such a drill or training had been performed.  
5.5. It could not be established why the chief officer, a veteran of the sea and a senior officer on 
board would have ignore d the warnings given by the b osun and enter ed the cargo hold, 
particularly a s number 5 cargo hold was not one of those identified by the fumigator as 
needing water removed.  
5.6. It could not be established what training the deceased deck crew member had received in the 
hazards of entering closed cargo hold s, but he might not have been aware of why the chief 
officer was unconscious, or may simply have been overwhelmed by an emotional urge to 
perform the rescue in spite of the danger to himself.  
5.7. The rescue response from the vessel 's master and crew was not well coordinated or practi sed, 
taking some 15 to 20 minutes to remove the bodies from the cargo hold and attempt 
resuscitation.  Given the survival time in the cargo hold atmosphere, any rescue attempt 
would have had to be immediate and efficient for either of the deceased to surviv e, which 
would have been  achievable if the entry into enclosed space s procedure had been followed in 
the first place.

 Report 10 -201 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies safety actions by two types:  
(a) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to  address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation; and  
(b) safety actions taken by the regulator or an operator to address other safety issues that 
would not normall y result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
6.2. The following s afety actions are not listed in any order of priority . 
(a) The Commission has forwarded this report to the IMO and invited the appropriate 
committee to note the contents of the report with a v iew to any future amendments to the 
procedures in the recommendations on entry into enclosed spaces.  
(b) On 25 May 2011 , Maritime New Zealand responded that:  
Over the last 12 -18 months, MNZ has been working to educate the wider 
maritime community, including sm all boat operators, about the dangers of 
entering confined spaces. Following the initial development and distribution of 
Safety Bulletin No.21 in September 2009, we again highlighted the problem in 
three successive issues of MNZ's Lookout magazine — June 2 010, September 
2010 and March 2011. Lookout has a wide distribution within the commercial 
sector and, to a lesser extent, the recreational sector.  
In addition, MNZ highlighted the issue in its September 2010 surveyor newsletter 
and continues to raise it a t Surveyor Seminars. In particular, MNZ has highlighted 
the fact that the risks apply to both small and larger vessels alike.  
The next step in widening the audience for this information, particularly those 
with small craft, could be to utilise the various  sector publications that are 
available, including Professional Skipper and Seafood NZ, rather than reissue 
Safety Bulletin 21.  
To this end, MNZ will to develop an article for distribution to be used by these 
and other media outlets .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of,  recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether th ose safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurrin g in the 
future.  
7.3. The Commission has not identified any new meaningful recommendations that could have 
prevented this accident that have not already been identified and widely taught both nationally 
and internationally through industry training organisation s and nationally through Maritime 
New Zealand educational material (see Appendix 4).  This occurrence report does, however, 
offer a number of lessons that can be useful to the maritime industry and the general public 
simply through its dissemination and re adership.

 Report 10 -201 8. Key lessons  
8.1. Enclosed (confined) spaces can kill.    
8.2. Never enter an enclosed (confined) space unless you have checked the atmosphere.    
8.3. Always follow the correct procedures for entering enclosed (confined) spaces.    
8.4. Manuals and written procedure s alone will not prevent accidents, but training and audit that 
ensures they are understood and are followed, probably will.

 Report 10 -201 Appendix 1 - Section 3 of the Code of Safe Practice fo r Solid Bulk Cargoes 
(BC Code)  
Safety of personnel and ship  
3.1 General requirements  
3.1.1 Prior to and during loading, transport and discharge of solid bulk cargoes all necessary  safety 
precautions, including any appropriate national regulations or requirements, should be  observed.  
3.1.2 Advice on medical matters is given in the IMO/WHO/ILO Medical First Aid Guide for  Use in 
Accidents Involving Dangerous Goods (MFAG). A copy of the MFAG should be on  board each ship.  
3.2 Poisoning, corrosive and asphy xiation hazards  
3.2.1 Certain solid bulk cargoes are susceptible to oxidation, which in turn may result in  oxygen 
reduction, emission of toxic fumes and self -heating. Some cargoes may not oxidize but  may emit 
toxic fumes, particularly when wet. There are a lso cargoes which, when wetted, are  corrosive to 
skin, eyes and mucous membranes or to the ship's structure. In these cases,  particular attention 
should be paid to protection of personnel and the need for special precautions  and measures to 
be taken prior to loading and after unloading.  
3.2.2 Therefore, it is important, that the shipper informs the master prior to loading as to  whether 
chemical hazards exist. The master should also refer to the individual entry for the  cargo involved 
and the necessary preca utions, especially those pertaining to ventilation.  
3.2.3 Shipmasters are warned that cargo spaces and adjacent spaces may be depleted in  oxygen or 
may contain toxic or asphyxiating gases. An empty cargo space or tank which has  remained 
closed for some tim e may have insufficient oxygen to support life.  
3.2.4 Many cargoes frequently carried in bulk are liable to cause oxygen depletion in a cargo  space or 
tank; these include most vegetable products, grains, timber logs and forest products,  ferrous 
metals, met al sulphide concentrates and coal cargoes.  
3.2.5 Entry of personnel into enclosed spaces should not be permitted until tests have been  carried out 
and it has been established that the oxygen content has been restored to a normal level  
throughout the space and that no toxic gas is present, unless adequate ventilation and air  
circulation throughout the free space above the cargo has been effected. It should be  
remembered that, after a cargo space or tank has been tested and generally found to be safe for  
entry, small areas may exist where oxygen is deficient or toxic fumes are still present.   
General precautions and procedures for entering enclosed spaces appear in Appendix 7. As  much 
publicity as possible should be given to the hazards associated with entry i nto enclosed  spaces. A 
poster on the subject should be produced. A specimen (reduced format) for such a  poster for 
display on board ships in accommodation or other places, as appropriate, has been  included in 
Appendix 7.  
3.2.6 When transporting bulk cargo which is liable to emit a toxic or flammable gas, or cause  oxygen 
depletion in the cargo space, an appropriate instrument for measuring the concentration  of gas 
or oxygen in the cargo space should be provided.  
3.2.7 It should be noted that a flammable gas detector is suitable only for testing the explosive  nature 
of gas mixtures.  
3.2.8 Emergency entry into a cargo space should be undertaken only by trained personnel  wearing self -
contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing and always under the  supe rvision of a 
responsible officer.  
3.3 Health hazards due to dust  
3.3.1 To minimize the chronic and acute risks due to exposure to the dust of certain cargoes  carried in 
bulk, the need for a high standard of personal hygiene of those exposed to the dust  cannot be too 
strongly emphasized. The precautions should include, not only the use of  appropriate protective 
clothing and barrier creams, when needed, but also adequate personal  washing and laundering 
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 25 >>
 of outer clothing. Whilst these precautions are good stan dard practice,  they are particularly 
relevant for those cargoes identified as toxic by this Code.  
3.4 Flammable atmosphere  
3.4.1 Dust created by certain cargoes may constitute an explosion hazard, especially while  loading, 
unloading and cleaning. This risk  can be minimized at such times by ensuring that  ventilation is 
sufficient to prevent the formation of a dust -laden atmosphere and by hosing down  rather than 
sweeping.  
3.4.2 Some cargoes may emit flammable gases in sufficient quantities to constitute a fir e or explosion 
hazard. Where this is indicated in the individual entries, the cargo spaces and adjacent  enclosed 
spaces should be effectively ventilated at all times (see also 9.3.2.1.3 for requirements  for 
mechanical ventilation). Also it may be necessary  to monitor the atmosphere in such spaces  by 
means of combustible gas indicators.  
3.5 Ventilation  
3.5.1 Where cargoes are carried which may emit toxic or flammable gases the cargo spaces  should be 
provided with effective ventilation.  
3.5.1.1 For the purpos e of this Code, ventilation means exchange of air from outside to inside  the 
cargo space to reduce any build -up of flammable gases or vapours to a safe level below 
the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL), or for toxic gases, vapours or dust to a level to maintain a 
safe atmosphere in a cargo space.  
3.5.1.2 For ventilation requirements, the following definitions should be applied:  
.1 natural ventilation means ventilation that is not power generated. An airflow is  
supplied by air ducts and/or other adequately designe d openings;  
.2 surface ventilation means ventilation only of the space above the cargo;  
.3 mechanical ventilation means power generated ventilation; and  
.4 continuous ventilation means ventilation that is operating at all times.  
3.5.2 Recommendations on ve ntilation  
.1 when continuous ventilation is required by the entry for the cargo in this Code or  by the cargo 
information provided by the shipper, ventilation should be  maintained while the cargo is in the 
hold; unless a situation develops where  ventilation  would endanger the ship;  
.2 if maintaining ventilation endangers the ship or the cargo, it may be interrupted  unless there is 
risk of explosion or other danger due to interruption of the  ventilation;  
.3 Holds intended for the carriage of cargoes for which  continuous ventilation is  required, should 
be provided with ventilation openings which may be kept opened  when required. Such 
openings should comply with the requirements of the  Load Line Convention as amended for 
openings not fitted with means of closure ; and 
.4 Ventilation should be such that any escaping hazardous gases, vapours or dust  cannot reach 
living quarters. Escaping hazardous gases9, vapours or dust should  not be able to reach work 
areas unless adequate precautions are taken (refer to  Appendix 7). 
3.6 Cargo under in -transit fumigation  
3.6.1 Fumigation should be performed in accordance with the Recommendations on the Safe  Use of 
Pesticides in Ships, set out in Appendix 8 of this Code.

(BC Code)  
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENTERING  
ENCLOSED SPACES ABOARD SHIPS  
Preamble  
The object of these recommendations is to encourage the adoption of safety procedures  aimed at 
preventing casualties to ships' personnel entering enclosed spaces where there may be  an oxygen -
deficient, flammable and/or toxic atmosphere.  
Investigations into the circumstances of casualties that have occurred have shown that  accidents on 
board ships are in most cases caused by an insufficient knowledge of, or disregar d for, the need to take 
precautions rather than a lack of guidance.  
The following practical recommendations apply to all types of ships and provide guidance  to seafarers. It 
should be noted that on ships where entry into enclosed spaces may be infrequent,  for example, on 
certain passenger ships or small general cargo ships, the dangers may be less  apparent, and 
accordingly there may be a need for increased vigilance.  
The recommendations are intended to complement national laws or regulations, accepted  stand ards or 
particular procedures, which may exist for specific trades, ships or types of shipping  operations.  
It may be impracticable to apply some recommendations to particular situations. In such  cases, every 
endeavour should be made to observe the intent o f the recommendations, and  attention should be paid 
to the risks that may be involved.  
1 Introduction  
The atmosphere in any enclosed space may be deficient in oxygen and/or contain  flammable and/or 
toxic gases or vapours. Such an unsafe atmosphere could al so subsequently  occur in a space previously 
found to be safe. Unsafe atmosphere may also be present in spaces  adjacent to those spaces where a 
hazard is known to be present.  
2 Definitions  
2.1 Enclosed space  means a space, which has any of the following characteristics:  
.1 limited openings for entry and exit;  
.2 unfavourable natural ventilation; and  
.3 is not designed for continuous worker occupancy,  
and includes, but is not limited to, cargo spaces, double b ottoms, fuel tanks, ballast tanks,  pump -
rooms, compressor rooms, cofferdams, void spaces, duct keels, inter -barrier spaces, engine  crankcases 
and sewage tanks.  
2.2 Competent person means a person with sufficient theoretical knowledge and practical  experien ce 
to make an informed assessment of the likelihood of a dangerous atmosphere being  present or 
subsequently arising in the space.  
2.3 Responsible person  means a person authorized to permit entry into an enclosed space and  having 
sufficient knowledge of the  procedures to be followed.  
3 Assessment of risk  
3.1 In order to ensure safety, a competent person should always make a preliminary  assessment of any 
potential hazards in the space to be entered, taking into account previous cargo  carried, ventilation 
of the space, coating of the space and other relevant factors. The competent  person's preliminary 
assessment should determine the potential for the presence of an  oxygen -deficient, flammable or 
toxic atmosphere.  
3.2 The procedures to be followed for testing th e atmosphere in the space and for entry  should be 
decided on the basis of the preliminary assessment. These will depend on whether the  preliminary 
assessment shows that:  .1 there is minimal risk to the health or life of personnel entering the 
space;  
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 27 >>
 .2 there is no immediate risk to health or life but a risk could arise during the course  of work in the 
space; and  
.3 a risk to health or life is identified.  
3.3 Where the preliminary assessment indicates minimal risk to health or life or potential for  a risk  to 
arise during the course of work in the space, the precautions described in 4, 5, 6 and 7  should be 
followed as appropriate.  
3.4 Where the preliminary assessment identifies risk to life or health, if entry is to be made,  the 
additional precautions speci fied in section 8 should also be followed.  
4 Authorization of entry  
4.1 No person should open or enter an enclosed space unless authorized by the master or  nominated 
responsible person and unless the appropriate safety procedures laid down for the  particul ar ship 
have been followed.  
4.2 Entry into enclosed spaces should be planned and the use of an entry permit system,  which may 
include the use of a checklist, is recommended. An Enclosed Space Entry Permit  should be issued 
by the master or nominated respons ible person, and completed by a person who  enters the space 
prior to entry. An example of the Enclosed Space Entry Permit is provided in  the appendix.  
5 General precautions  
5.1 The master or responsible person should determine that it is safe to enter an e nclosed  space by 
ensuring:  
.1 that potential hazards have been identified in the assessment and as far as possible  isolated or 
made safe;  
.2 that the space has been thoroughly ventilated by natural or mechanical means to  remove any 
toxic or flammable gases , and to ensure an adequate level of oxygen  throughout the space;  
.3 that the atmosphere of the space has been tested as appropriate with properly   calibrated 
instruments to ascertain acceptable levels of oxygen and acceptable  levels of flammable or toxic 
vapours;  
.4 that the space has been secured for entry and properly illuminated;  
.5 that a suitable system of communication between all partie s for use during entry  has been 
agreed and tested;  
.6 that an attendant has been instructed to remain at the entra nce to the space whilst  it is 
occupied;  
.7 that rescue and resuscitation equipment has been positioned ready for use at the  entrance to 
the space, and that rescue arrangements have been agreed;  
.8 that personnel are properly clothed and equipped for the en try and subsequent  tasks; and  
.9 that a permit has been issued authorizing entry.  
The precautions in .6 and .7 may not apply to every situation described in this section. The  person 
authorizing entry should determine whether an attendant and the positionin g of rescue  equipment at 
the entrance to the space is necessary.  
5.2 Only trained personnel should be assigned the duties of entering, functioning as  attendants, or 
functioning as members of rescue teams. Ships' crews should be drilled  periodically in resc ue and 
first aid.  
5.3 All equipment used in connection with entry should be in good working condition and   inspected 
prior to use.  
6 Testing the atmosphere  
6.1 Appropriate testing of the atmosphere of a space should be carried out with properly  calibrated 
equipment by persons trained in the use of the equipment. The manufacturers'  instructions should 
be strictly followed. Testing should be carried out before any person enters  the space, and at 
regular intervals thereafter until all work is completed. Where appropriate, the  testing of the space 
should be carried out at as many different levels as is necessary to obtain a  representative sample 
of the atmosphere in the space.  

<< Page 28 >>
 Report 10 -201 6.2 For entry purposes, steady readings of the following should be obtained:  
.1 21% ox ygen by volume by oxygen content meter; and  
.2 not more than 1% of lower flammable limit (LFL) on a suitably sensitive  combustible gas 
indicator, where the preliminary assessment has determined that  there is potential for 
flammable gases or vapours.  
If the se conditions cannot be met, additional ventilation should be applied to the space and  re-testing 
should be conducted after a suitable interval. Any gas testing should be carried out  with ventilation to 
the enclosed space stopped, in order to obtain accura te readings.  
6.3 Where the preliminary assessment has determined that there is potential for the presence  of toxic 
gases and vapours, appropriate testing should be carried out using fixed or portable gas  or vapour 
detection equipment. The readings obtained  by this equipment should be below the  occupational 
exposure limits for the toxic gases or vapours given in accepted national or  international standards. 
It should be noted that testing for flammability does not provide a  suitable means of measuring for 
toxicity, nor vice versa.  
6.4 It should be emphasized that pockets of gas or oxygen -deficient areas can exist, and  should always 
be suspected, even when an enclosed space has been satisfactorily tested as being  suitable for 
entry.  
7 Precautions during entr y 
7.1 The atmosphere should be tested frequently whilst the space is occupied, and persons  should be 
instructed to leave the space should there be deterioration in the conditions.  
7.2 Ventilation should continue during the period that the space is occupied  and during  temporary 
breaks. Before re -entry after a break, the atmosphere should be re -tested. In the event  of failure of 
the ventilation system, any persons in the space should leave immediately.  
7.3 In the event of an emergency, under no circumstances should the attending crew member  enter the 
space before help has arrived and the situation has been evaluated to ensure the safety  of those 
entering the space to undertake rescue operations.  
8 Additional precautions for entry into a space where the atmosphere is known or  suspected to be 
unsafe  
8.1 If the atmosphere in an enclosed space is suspected or known to be unsafe, the space  should only 
be entered when no practical alternative exists. Entry should only be made for  further testing, 
essential ope ration, and safety of life or safety of a ship. The number of persons  entering the space 
should be the minimum compatible with the work to be performed.  
8.2 Suitable breathing apparatus, e.g. air -line or self -contained type, should always be worn,  and only  
personnel trained in its use should be allowed to enter the space. Air -purifying  respirators should 
not be used, as they do not provide a supply of clean air from a source  independent of the 
atmosphere within the space.  
8.3 The precautions specified in 5 should also be followed, as appropriate.  
8.4 Rescue harnesses should be worn and, unless impractical, lifelines should be used.  
8.5 Appropriate protective clothing should be worn, particularly where there is any risk of  toxic 
substances or chemicals coming  into contact with the skin or eyes of those entering the  space.  
8.6 The advice in 7.3 concerning emergency rescue operations is particularly relevant in this  context.  
9 Hazards related to specific types of cargo  
9.1 Dangerous goods in packaged form  
9.1.1 The atmosphere of any space containing dangerous goods may put at risk the health or  life of any 
person entering it. Dangers may include flammable, toxic or corrosive gases or  vapours that 
displace oxygen, residues on packages and spilled material. The sam e hazards may  be present in 
spaces adjacent to the cargo spaces. Information on the hazards of specific  substances is 
contained in the IMDG Code, the Emergency Response Procedures for Ships  Carrying Dangerous 
Goods (EmS Guide) and Materials Safety Data She ets (MSDS). If there is  evidence or suspicion 
that leakage of dangerous substances has occurred, the precautions  specified in 8 should be 
followed.  
  
Report 10 -201 
<< Page 29 >>
 9.1.2 Personnel required to deal with spillages or to remove defective or damaged packages  should be 
appropr iately trained and wear suitable breathing apparatus and appropriate protective  clothing.  
9.2 Bulk liquid  
9.2.1 The tanker industry has produced extensive advice to operators and crews of ships  engaged in 
the bulk carriage of oil, chemicals and liquefied g ases, in the form of specialist  international 
safety guides. Information in the guides on enclosed space entry amplifies these  
recommendations and should be used as the basis for preparing entry plans.  
9.3 Solid bulk  
9.3.1 On ships carrying solid bulk carg oes, dangerous atmospheres may develop in cargo  spaces and 
adjacent spaces. The dangers may include flammability, toxicity, oxygen depletion or  self-heating, 
which should be identified in shipping documentation. For additional information,  reference 
should  be made to the Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes.  
9.4 Oxygen -depleting cargoes and materials  
9.4.1 A prominent risk with such cargoes is oxygen depletion due to the inherent form of the  cargo, for 
example, self - heating, oxidation of metals and  ores or decomposition of vegetable oils,  animal 
fats, grain and other organic materials or their residues.  
9.4.2 The materials listed below are known to be capable of causing oxygen depletion.  However, the list 
is not exhaustive. Oxygen depletion may also  be caused by other materials of  vegetable or animal 
origin, by flammable or spontaneously combustible materials, and by  materials with a high metal 
content:  
.1 grain, grain products and residues from grain processing (such as bran, crushed  grain, crushed 
malt or meal), hops, malt husks and spent malt;  
.2 oilseeds as well as products and resid ues from oilseeds (such as seed expellers,  seed cake, oil 
cake and meal);  
.3 copra;  
.4 wood in such forms as packaged timber, roundwood, logs, pulpwood, props  (pit props and other 
propwood), woodchips, woodshavings, woodpulp pellets and  sawdust;  
.5 jute, hemp, flax, sisal, kapok, cotton and other vegetable fibres (such as esparto  grass/Spanish 
grass, hay, straw, bhusa), empty bags, cotton waste, animal fibres,  animal and vegetable fabric, 
wool waste and rags;  
.6 fishmeal and fishscrap;  
.7 guano;  
.8 sulphidic ores and ore concentrates;  
.9 charcoal, coal and coal products;  
.10 direct reduced iron (DRI);  
.11 dry ice;  
.12 metal wastes and chips, iron swarf, steel and  other turnings, borings, drillings,  shavings, filings 
and cuttings; and  
.13 scrap metal.  
9.5 Fumigation  
9.5.1 When a ship is fumigated, the Recommendations on the Safe Use of Pesticides in Ships,  
reproduced in Appendix 8, should be followed. Spaces adjace nt to fumigated spaces should be  
treated as if fumigated.  
10 Conclusion  
10.1 Failure to observe simple procedures can lead to people being unexpectedly overcome  when 
entering enclosed spaces. Observance of the principles outlined above will form a reliable  basis 
for assessing risks in such spaces and for taking necessary precautions.
