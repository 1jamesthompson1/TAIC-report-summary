The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve  transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( the Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry 
and an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents  and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar  occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 18 January 2016, the restricted -limits passenger vessel PeeJay V  was on an all -day 
excursion from Whakatāne out to White Island with 53 passengers and seven crew on board.  
The PeeJay V  was near the end of the journey and approaching the Whakatāne Harbour 
entrance when fire broke out in the engine room.  
1.2. The crew released the fixed C O2 fire extinguish er into the engine room, which suppressed the 
fire for a short time.  However, the fire quickly escalated, forcing the skipper to order everyone 
to abandon the vessel.  Several vessels in the vicinity responded to the skipper’s distress call.  
All persons were eventually transferred to the assisting vessels.  However, due to the speed 
with which the fire gained intensity several passengers were forced to enter the water without 
a life -jacket.  
1.3. The crew were not able to access all of the li fe-jackets on board because of the fire.  For the 
same reason they were not able to launch the flotation raft that was stored on top of the 
vessel’s flybridge.  
1.4. The PeeJay V  burnt to the waterline and sank.  One crew member suffered from smoke 
inhalation , but o therwise nobody else was seriously injured.  
1.5. Due to the lack of physical evidence to work with, the Commission was unable to conclusively 
establish the cause of the fire.   The Commission found  that the absence of a  fire detection 
and automatic alarm sy stem on  the PeeJay V  meant the crew had limited warning time  and 
opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life -saving apparatus . 
1.6. The Commission also found  that the CO2 fire suppression system, which was supposed to 
work by displacing the air in t he engine room with CO2, was not effective in suppressing the 
fire. This was because  air was able to enter the engine room through several openings, 
including a cable duct that  had no means of being closed.  
1.7. The Commission also found that the placement of t he life -saving apparel and equipment on 
board was appropriate.  The fact that it could not all be accessed highlights the difficulty 
operators of smaller vessels have in choosing wh ere to locate such equipment.  
1.8. Three main safety issues  identified during the inquiry were:  
 Maritime Rules did not require the PeeJay V  to have fire detection or automatic fire 
alarms installed even though it could carry up to 90 passengers and operate up to 12 
nautical miles from the coast  
 the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system ins talled in the engine room could not be fully 
effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be 
fully closed down  
 the builder and operators of the vessel did not fully appreciate the principles of how 
the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system operated . 
1.9. The Commission made one  new recommendation  and invited the Director of Maritime New 
Zealand to implement an existing  previous recommendation  to address these safety issues . 
1.10.  The key lessons  arising  from th is inquiry are : 
 early detection of a fire on board a vessel is critical to a successful fire -fighting 
response and for the early preparation of life -saving apparel and equipment  
 crew must be fully familiar with and trained in the use of fire -fighting systems on 
board, otherwise  the systems might not be of any use in fighting a fire  
 even if a fixed CO2 fire-fighting apparatus is fully functional, it will only be effective in 
fighting a fire if the design of the space it is protecting can be fully closed off .

 Final Report MO -2016 -201 2. Conduct of the inquir y 
2.1. On 18 January 2016 at about 1600 the Commission received notification from Maritime New 
Zealand (MNZ) of a fire on  board the charter vessel Pee Jay V. The vessel had 53 passengers 
and seven  crew on  board, and was anchored about one kilometre  off the coast near 
Whakatāne . The PeeJay V  was abandoned , all persons on  board were accounted for, and the 
vessel sank that evening.  
2.2. The same day the Commission opened an inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator  in charge .  
2.3. On 19 January , two investigators travelled to Whakatāne to conduct enquir ies, including 
conducting interviews and collecting  evidence.  They returned to Wellington on 21 January.  
2.4. On 22 January , a preservation and protection order was issued under the Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission Act 1990 with respect to the wreck and flotsam from the Pee Jay V . 
2.5. On 30 January , the Commission circulated an online survey to the passengers who were on  
board the PeeJay V  at the time of the fire. The survey received 42  responses.  
2.6. On 11 February , a dive survey of the wreck was conducted by the harbourmaster, and on 8 
April divers contracted by the Commission surveyed the wreck.  
2.7. The Commission also gathered information from MNZ , the surveyor  company , and people 
involved in building and maintaining the vessel.   
2.8. On 23 August 2017, the Commission approved the draft report for circulation to six interested 
parties.  
2.9. On 13 December 201 7, the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  White Island Tours (the operator) operated the PeeJay V  out of Port Whakatāne to provide 
scheduled one -day tours to White Island and other locations of interest.  
3.1.2.  At 0800 on 18 January 2016, t he PeeJay V  was berthed alongside the wharf in Whakatāne .  
The skipper  arrived shortly after  0800 and began preparing the vessel for its scheduled sailing 
at 1000 .  
3.1.3.  As part of the pre-sailing  preparation s he reviewed the recen t entries that had been made in 
the maintenance logbook,  opened the engine  room hatch and visually inspected the bilge  and 
bilge pump , fuel level, the batteries, steering system, generator and the inverter .  He started 
the engines and checked systems befor e shutting them down again.  During his pre -sailing 
checks the skipper did not notice anything irregular.  He returned to the bridge (shown in 
Figure 1) and continued preparations for sailing.  
3.1.4.  Meanwhile the rest of the crew had arrived and were carrying ou t their preparations for sailing , 
which included checking the soft inflatable boat ( SIB), cleaning duties and preparing the 
passenger  facilities .

3.1.5.  By about 0920 all seven crew were aboard and all pre -sailing preparation s were completed.  
3.1.6.  At about 1000 t he passengers started boarding .  When all 53 passengers were aboard the 
crew delivered the introductory  briefing .  The briefing included an overview of the day ’s 
itinerary, the location  of life -jackets and other information pertinent to the safety and 
enjoyment of the passengers.  At about 1010 the skipper  started the engines  and the PeeJay V  
departed Whakatāne . The PeeJay V  cross ed the Whakatāne River bar at about 1015 and 
began the 26  nautical mile ( nm) passage to White Island (shown in Figure 2) .

Figure 2 
Chart showing approximate track of the PeeJay V  on its passage to and from White Island2 
3.1.7.  At about 1145 the PeeJay V  moored to a single buoy mooring in Works Bay at White Island 
and transferred passengers ashore using the  vessel’s  SIB. They returned to the PeeJay V  at 
about 1330 .   
3.1.8.  Once all the pas sengers were back aboard the skipper  slipped the mooring  and moved the 
vessel  to anchor at Black Rock  on the south west  side of the island  where it was  more 
sheltered from the weather for the passengers to have lunch . After lunch they raised the 
anchor a nd began the return passage to Whakatāne . 
3.1.9.  At about 1530 the PeeJay V  was about half a nautical mile  away from  crossing the Whakatāne 
bar when t he tour manager and a deckhand standing near the galley  (shown in Figure 1)  smelt 
fumes .  The deckhand  immediately went up the stairs to the flybridge from where he could 
alert the skipper in the wheelhouse .  The skipper  checked  the wheelhouse dashboard gauges  
and control panels but did not see or hear anything irregular.  
3.1.10.  Another deckhand  standing alongside the skipper  in the wheelhouse  went down the stairs to 
investigate , but by the time he had reached the bottom of the s tairs he could see smoke 
coming out from the galley cabinets. He could not see any flames, but s moke w as quickly 
filling the cabin . The other crew member who had followed him down the stairs returned to tell 
the skipper  it was ‘bad’.  
3.1.11.  At about the same tim e the tour manager  began  evacuating the passengers from the main 
deck cabin  out onto the starboard side deck  where they proceeded forward to muster on the 
foredeck . Less than  about 30 seconds passed between the crew first smelling fumes  and 
thick  grey smoke beginning to fill the cabin.  
                                                        
2 The 12 nm limit is the territorial waters of New Zealand. White Island is a part of New Zealand and therefore 
has a 12 nm limit around it. The 12 nm limits of White Island and the North Island overlap, so the 12nm limit 
line on the chart appears as a bulge around White Island.  


<< Page 6 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -201 3.1.12.  At about 1540 t he skipper  called the Coastguard on channel 80 on the very high frequency 
(VHF)  radio to request assistance. At about 154 4 the skipper  spoke on the telephone with the 
operator’s sea operations manager ash ore to request assistance .  He knew the sea operations 
manager was aboard another vessel , the PeeJay IV , and would be able to respond  quickly . The 
skipper  had also called the reception at White Island Tours to report the vessel was on fire and 
to request t hey send boats to help.   
3.1.13.  The skipper  had brought the vessel head -to-wind and requested one of the deckhands to drop 
the anchor.   
 
Figure 3 
The approach to Whakatāne River bar showing position that PeeJay V  foundered  
3.1.14.  Once the passengers had been evacuated from the cabin the tour manager attempted to 
contain the fire by closing the fire flaps to the engine  room. The cabin had filled with thick 
smoke , and he put his head through the side window to breath e while he clos ed the fire flaps . 
He closed five of the six fire flaps . Once he had closed the five flaps another crew member 
activated the fixed fire smothering system to flood the engine room with CO2.  The CO2 
appeared to subdue the fire for about six minutes before smoke started flowing from the cabin 
again.  D uring this time the tour manager returned to the cabin and close d the last fire flap.  
3.1.15.  At about 1550 a member of the public who could see the vessel was on fire telephoned the 
police to report  the incident.  P olice relayed the message through to the Marine Operations 
Centre.  Plenty Maritime Radio broadcast a Mayday relay , ‘…of a possible boat fire, half a mile 
off Kohi Point Whakatāne , no other information to hand… ’.  
3.1.16.  The crew launched the SIB from its stowage l ocation in the stern of the vessel , and from it 
were  able to conduct a head count .  From video taken at the time by a passenger i t was 
evident t here were 33 passengers mustered on the foredeck . There were also 20 on the 
flybridge level  mustered on the side  deck and forward of the bridge .  
3.1.17.  Life-jackets on  board the PeeJay V  were stored in three locations : the forward cabin, the 
flybridge and the lazarette.  The crew were able to access the life -jackets stored on the 
flybridge and distribute them to  the passengers in the vicinity .  However , the life -jackets stored 
in the forward cabin and lazarette were not accessible  due to the fire . The passengers 
mustered on the foredeck were not provided with life-jackets.  
3.1.18.  The skipper  of the PeeJay V  used the VHF radio to broadcast a Mayday signal at about 1557.  

 
Final Report MO -2016 -201 
<< Page 7 >>
 3.1.19.  By about 1558 t wo other vessels  had put to se a and were standing  off the PeeJay V  ready to 
assist . Once the assisting vessels were in position the skipper  of the PeeJay V  ordered 
‘abandon ship ’.   The crew instructed the passengers to jump into the water  so they could be 
picked up by the PeeJay V ’s crew in the SIB and transferred to one of the two assisting 
vessels.  
3.1.20.  Due to the location of the fire , the crew were not able to access enough life -jackets for 
everyone on  board .  Once each passenger  with a life -jacket had jumped overboard and  was 
safe on  board the rescue vessel their life -jacket  was passed back on board  the PeeJay V  and 
used by the passengers still on  board .  As the fire grew the pressure to abando n ship 
increased, and in total about 18  passengers  jump ed from the PeeJay V  without wearing a life-
jacket.   
3.1.21.  The PeeJay V  was fitted with a 10 person C arley  float, which is a solid raft fitted with rope 
hand -holds.  The Carley  float can be thrown into the water in an emergency and acts as a 
flotation support for passengers and crew to hold onto in the water.  The Carley  float was 
located on the roof of the flybridge.  Due to the fire the crew were unable to access the rooftop 
to launch the Carley float . 
3.1.22.  By about 1620 a ll of the passengers and crew , including the skipper , had been transferred to 
the assisting vessels.   
3.1.23.  The passengers and crew disembarked alongside in Whakatāne . There were no significant 
injuries reported , although o ne of the crew had suffered minor smoke inhalation.  
3.1.24.  Plenty Maritime Radio cancelled the distress signal at about 1708  and the PeeJay V  sank later 
that evening . 
3.2. Vessel details  
3.2.1.  In 2001 , the owner contracted Carey’s Boatyard (the builder) to build and deliver a vessel in 
full survey for 90 passengers  to operate within inshore limits , which  is defined as the territorial 
sea of New Zealand , nominally within 12 nm of the coast.   
3.2.2.  The builder contracted a naval architect to provide design drawings for the hull  shape  and 
general arrangement  of the vessel . The design was approved by Survey Nelson (the surveyor)  
as meeting the requirements  of Maritime Rules Part 40A – Design, Construction, and 
Equipment –Passenger Ships which are not SOLAS ( Safety Of Life At Sea ) Ships.  This Maritime 
Rule came into force on 1 February 2001 , and prescribes the requirements for the design, 
construction and equipment of New Zealand passenger ships such as the PeeJay V . 
3.2.3.  The builder constructed the vessel to the  approved  drawing s. The  detail design and  
construction of the vessel , including  the engineering systems , were carried out  by the builder 
‘in-house ’. There were no design drawings of the engineering systems available to the 
Commission  to verify fire detection and/or automatic fire alarms . The surveyor inspected the 
vessel and its systems at various stages during construction to confirm it complied with  the 
requirements of the Maritime Rules , in particular Part 40A . The PeeJay V  was con structed with 
a composite of timber and fibreglass reinforced plastic.  
3.2.4.  The surveyor  issued a Fit-For-Purpose certificate in 2003 and the vessel was put  into service  
the same  year. SGS Tauranga became the surveyor for the PeeJay V  in February 2011.  
3.2.5.  On 1 Jul y 2014 , when the Marine Operator Safety System ( MOSS)  came into force , the PeeJay 
V had a  valid  Fit-for-Purpose certificate and a current New Zealand Safe Ship Management 
certificate. Hence it was deemed to have a valid certificate of survey.   
3.3. Fire protection, detection and fire-fighting systems  of the PeeJay V   
3.3.1.  Under Maritime Rule 40A , the PeeJay V  was required to have a fixed fire -fighting system for 
use in the event of a fire in the engine room. The PeeJay V  had a CO2 flooding system 
installed .  

<< Page 8 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -201 3.3.2.  The PeeJay V  also had various portable fire extinguishers located around the vessel : 
 three 4.5  kilogram ( kg) dry powder type extinguishers distributed through the cabin  
and saloon  
 one 2  kg dry powder type extinguisher in the galley   
 two 4 litre foam type extinguishers in the engine  room  
 one 49 kg CO2 type extinguisher for the engine room with the trigger and gas bottle 
located in the cockpit . 
3.3.3.  The crew did not have the opportunity to deploy the portable fire extinguishers  effectively due 
to the location and  the speed with which the fire took hold . 
3.3.4.  The PeeJay V  was fitted with a manual push button alarm to alert passengers and crew in the 
event of an emergency.  The o perators believed the PeeJay V  was fitted with a fire detection 
system and automatic fire alar m and this point is discussed in section 4.3 of this report . 
3.3.5.  The survey  company (during construction) found the PeeJay V  complied with the Maritime 
Rules with respect to s tructural fire protection and fire divisions. However , the Commission 
found some issues with the integrity  of the arrangement , which are discussed in section 4.6 of 
this report.  
3.4. Life-saving appliances of the PeeJay V   
3.4.1.  The PeeJay V ’s safety equipment list identified 107 foam life-jackets distributed between t he 
forward cabin and the flybridge. There were also a number of foam life-jackets stored in the 
lazarette.  
3.4.2.  A Carley3 float for 10 persons was c arried on the roof abo ve the flybridge.  
3.4.3.  The PeeJay V  also had a SIB rescue boat which was certified to carry 1 6 people.  
3.5. Crew  
3.5.1.  The m inimum number of crew required to safely crew the PeeJay V  was dependent on where it 
was operating and how many passengers it had on  board.  The PeeJay V  minimum safe 
manning required by MNZ for the area of operations on the day of the fire was:  
 skipper with minimum qualification of Skippers Restricted Limits ( SRL)  
 one deck  crew  with minimum qualification of  Qualified Deck Crew ( QDC)  
 two crew with no minimum qualification . 
3.5.2.  The PeeJay V  crew also acted as guides for the tours on White Isl and. The tours required more 
guides than the minimum number of crew required by M NZ, hence the the PeeJay V sailed 
with more than the minimum required crew. On the day of the accident there w ere seven crew 
on board.  
3.5.3.  The skipper gained a  certificate of competency as skipper of a Coastal Fishing Boat and a 
Second -Class Diesel  Trawler engineer ’s certificate in 1982.  He joined White Island Tours as a 
skipper in 2013.

 4. Analysis  
4.1. General  
4.1.1.  The PeeJay V  was a passenger vessel used to take  tourists  from Whakatāne to White Island 
and back.  During a return voyage a catastrophic fire took hold  and the vessel burned to the 
waterline and sank .  All passengers and crew abandoned the vessel and were recovered  
without significant injury . 
4.1.2.  The vessel was designed and built specifically for the type of operation it was engaged in on 
the day of the accident.  MNZ had issued the operator with a Maritime Transport Operators 
Certificate, but had not yet conducted the initial  audit  scheduled for t he following year .  
4.1.3.  The Commission identified three safety issues relat ing to the implementation of the vessel ’s 
safety management system and the fire detection and extinguishing system on board :   
  the PeeJay V could carry  up to 90 passengers and operat e up to 12 nm from the coast , 
and ve ry likely  did not  have fire detection or automatic fire alarms installed  
 the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine  room could  not be fully effective 
in extinguishing  the fire  because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed 
down  
 the builder and operators of the vessel did not  fully appreciate the principles of how the 
CO2 fixed fir e-fighting  system  operated.  
4.2. Source of ignition  and location of the fire 
4.2.1.  The fire con sumed the entire vessel down to the waterline, at which point it sank.  
Consequently , there was very little physical evidence remaining  and the Commission was 
unable to conclusively establish the cause of the fire . 
4.2.2.  The first sign of smoke came from within the galley cabinets  above the engine  room , and later 
thick smoke was seen flowing from the engine room vents.  It is very likely  therefore that the 
fire started in the engine room.  
4.2.3.  The underwater survey of the wreck showed the charring in the timber hull was deepest in the 
forward starboard area of the engine  room.  Depth of charring is one indica tor of how long a 
fire has burnt  for.  However, it can also be an indicator of the intensity of the fire in that area.  
Factors affecting the intensity of a fire i nclude the supply of air to the space and the 
combustibility of materials in the area.   
4.2.4.  Most of the  electrical installations and systems  were located in the starboard forward area of 
the engine room , but so too was  the hydraulic tank for the steering syst em.  Electrical systems 
are a common cause of fires on small vessels.  However, o nce ignited, hydraulic oil is known 
to burn with intensity , which could be one explanation for the deeper charring in the area.   The 
deeper charring in that area was therefore  not necessarily proof that the fire originated in that 
area.

Figure 4 
Composit e image of the forward starboard area of  the PeeJay V  engine  room  (from survey records)  
4.2.5.  There are a number of other common causes of fire.  Ruptured  high pressure fuel lines can 
spray fuel onto hot surfaces .  However, the fuel lines on the PeeJay V’s  engine were effectively 
enclosed within the engine  and the lines from the  main  fuel tank entered at its aft end.  
4.2.6.  Engine exhaust failure direct ing hot exha ust gas onto a flammable material  is another 
potential cause .  However,  the exhaust system was located at the aft end of the engine room.  
4.2.7.  The main batte ries were  situated approximately mid -point on the starboard side of the engine 
room .  It was not possibl e to establish what level of electrical protection was built into the 
system to prevent a short circuit from causing a fire.  
4.2.8.  Spontaneous or assisted combustion of oily rags  and detritus  is another known cause o f fires.  
However,  the engine room was known to have been kept in a clean and tidy state .   
Finding  
1. The Commission determined that the fire likely started in the  engine room.  
However , the Commission has not been  able to determine the cause of the 
fire.

 4.3.  Fire detection  
Safety issue: a vessel  certified to carry up to 90 passengers  and operating up to 12 nm from 
the coast very likely did not  have fire detection  equipment  or automatic  fire alarms installed . 
4.3.1.  Maritime Rules Part 19 Maritime Transport Operator – Certification and Responsibilities. The 
purpose of Part 19 is to require maritime transport operators to develop, and operate in 
accordance with, safety systems that are specific and appropriate to their maritime transport 
operation. The Maritime Transpor t Operator Safety System is known as MOSS and is regulated 
by MNZ . 
4.3.2.  To enter MOSS, the operator must develop a Maritime Transport Operator Plan (MTOP) and 
submit it for a desktop review and site visit by MNZ .  When MNZ  are satisfied the MTOP 
complies with P art 19 , they issue a Maritime Transport Operators Certificate (MTOC) to the 
operator.  The maritime rules require that the MTOP ensures:  
 19.42 1 (a) ; identify and manage the safety risks involved in the maritime transport 
operation ’. 
 19.42 2 (c) ; Address ‘all reasonably foreseeable hazards associated with the… 
operation ’. 
4.3.3.  There are effectively two steps to achieving those requirements. The first step is to identify the 
risks to the operation and develop controls for those risks.  For example, the operator h ad 
identified that fire in the engine room was a risk, and hence the safety management system 
included a specific emergency procedure for that risk (see Appendix 1 Emergency procedures 
for fire).  
4.3.4.  The second step is to continuously monitor and review the op eration for emerging risks or 
safety hazards.  
4.3.5.  The PeeJay V  was built subject to Rule 40A which required that surfaces and materials of the 
engine room had ‘low flame spread’, ‘fire -resisting’ or ‘non -combustible’ properties.  The use 
of such materials gave  more time to detect and fight a fire.  It is not known how long th is fire 
had been burning in the engine compartment before smoke was first observed in the galley.  
The first i ndication  of the fire was when the crew members standing adjacent to t he galley  
smelt fumes .  Because the source of the fire could not be determined, it is not known whether 
the fire had been building for some time or whether the onset was rapid . 
4.3.6.  There was a heat detector  with a flashing light  fitted in the engine  room, but it was no t 
connected to an alarm and hence was of limited benefit.   Nobody could recall  whether any 
other form of fire detection and automatic alarm system was installed on the vessel.  There 
was nothing recorded in the vessel ’s documentation  or maintenance plan and records, nor in 
the survey records .  The survey checklist was notated ‘not applicable’ against the item fire 
detectors and automatic fire alarms. T he crew were not aware of any detection  and automatic 
alarm panel in the wheelhouse.   It is therefore very unlikely that any form of useful fire 
detection and alarm system was installed on the vessel.  
4.3.7.  Maritime Rules do not require fire detection or automatic fire alarms to be fitted o n board a 
restricted -limits4 vessel less than 24  metres (m) , such as the PeeJay V .  If the  vessel had been 
over 24  m in length maritime rules would require  fire detection and automatic fire alarms to 
have been installed , regardless of how many people it was permitted to carry.  Yet being under 
24 m meant that no s uch a system was required . 
4.3.8.  Maritime rules are minimum standards that must be met , but operators can install a greater 
level of safety commensurate with the risk involved.  Risk is a function of consequence and 
the likelihood of an accident happening.  The consequence of a fire in the engine room of a 
passenger vessel is significant and the likelihood potentially greater than  for some  other areas 
of the vessel.  
                                                        
4 Restricted limits means enclosed water limits and inshore water limits.  

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -201 4.3.9.  Safety management systems require operators to identify all of the hazards involved with their 
operation, and either eliminate or mitigate the hazard to reduce the risk to as low as 
reasonably practicable.  
4.3.10.  The operator’s hazard register focused mainly on personal injury , such as slips , trips and falls, 
and gave limited consideration to fire and other c atastrophic events. The only mention of fire 
in the hazard register was the spontaneous combustion of dirty rags in the engine room . 
4.3.11.  In 2003 , the Commission published a report concerning a fire in the engine  room of a 20  m 
long passenger vessel.  That inve stigation , and subsequent discussion with the Maritime 
Safety Agency ,5 resulted in a  recommendation  (033/03)  to the Director of the Maritime Safety 
Agency that:  
When conducting any review of maritime rule part 40A (Design and Equipment – 
Passenger Ships S OLAS) undertake a cost benefit analysis to consider any 
existing restricted limit passenger ships with totally enclosed engine spaces to be 
fitted with a fire detection system and a remotely operated fire extinguishing 
system in the engine space.  
Where a c ost benefit is demonstrated as positive, consider drafting an 
amendment to maritime rule part 40A for the Minister’s consideration.  
Any amendment of the rule to be phased so that existing passenger vessels 
above 15m, or carrying more than 36 passengers to be fitted with this equipment 
first.  
4.3.12.  Although automatic fire alarms were not specifically mentioned in the above recommendation, 
it logically follows that any fire detection system should incorporate an automatic alarm 
system.  Since the recommendation was  made Maritime Rules Part Rule 40A remains 
unchanged with respect to mandatory fire detection and automatic fire alarms on restricted -
limits vessels.   The recommendation is applicable to this accident as well.  Currently , the 
recommendation remains with an  open status.  Consequently,  the Commission has not 
repeated the recommendation , but draws the Director ’s attention to the safety issue and 
invites his further consideration of the issue in the interests of maritime transport safety . 
4.3.13.  The matter is on M NZ’s policy issue register, and is due to be considered as part of the 
comprehensive review of the Maritime Rules Part Rule 40 for 2017/18.    
4.4. Fighting the fire 
Safety issue: the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine  room could  not be fully 
effective in extinguishing  the fire  because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed 
down.  
4.4.1.  Fire is a chain reaction of rapid oxidation of a material  and it requires three ingredients to 
continue: heat, fuel and oxygen.  If one of the ingredient s is removed the fire will be 
extinguished.  A CO2 flooding system is designed to displace the oxygen within a compartment  
and thus extinguish any fire within that space.   It is a fire -fighting system commonly used in a 
vessel ’s engine  room.  
4.4.2.  A CO2 flooding  system consist s of liquid CO2 stored in gas cylinders, a manual triggering 
mechanism, and a valve and pipe arrangement distribut ing CO2 from the cylinder into the 
engine room.   The CO2 cylinders and the manual triggering mechanism are located outside the 
compartment they were  designed to protect.   
4.4.3.  The integrity of a CO2 flooding system in subduing a fire is dependent on depriving the fire of 
oxygen.   For the CO2 flooding system to work effectively , it follows that the compartment must 
be impervious to the escape of CO 2, or to the re-entry of air.  This outcome is embodied in the 
Maritime Rules Part 42B.20 (4) [with respect to CO2 flooding systems] , ‘Means must be 
provided to close all openings that ma y admit or allow gas to escape from a protected space ’.  
A CO2 flooding system will only work effectively if the c ompartment  has been sealed  by closing

 all doors , ducts  and vents and then manually triggering the system and inject ing CO2 into th e 
compartmen t.  
4.4.4.  The engine room of the PeeJay V  was designed with a ventilation system to supply air for the 
engines. The ventilation system included a forced draft fan to force  air into the engine  room. 
There was also a set of passive ducts which vented the engine room to the atmosphere.  
4.4.5.  The passive ducts were fitted with flaps which could be closed in the event of a fire .  The 
forced draft fan could be turned off remotely and also had a flap which could be closed . 
4.4.6.  When the CO2 system was triggered it did suppress t he fire , but only for a few minutes.   The 
reason for this was there were at least four ways for fresh air to enter the engine room after 
the CO2 had been injected into the compartment : 
 one of the engine room ventilation flaps was closed some  time after the  CO2 system 
had been triggered  
 the master turned off the power to the forced draft fan when the fire was first 
discovered, but the crew were not able to close the fire flap over the duct as the  
closing mechanism was located within the lazarette  
 during interview s the operators acknowledged a duct, or ducts,  that ran from the 
engine room  and vented to the atmosphere but did not have any method of clos ure 
 smoke from the engine room was seen flowing out from the galley cabinets  located 
above the engine room , but if it  could flow out from the engine room then air could 
flow in.  
4.4.7.  Two of the four means for fresh air to enter the engine room were related to construction and 
two to crew training  
4.5. Construction  
4.5.1.  The boat builder had built two vessels for the owner pr ior to the PeeJay V .  The contract for 
PeeJay V  was for the builder to manage the project, design and build the vessel. The owner 
would take delivery of a completed vessel with a Fit -For-Purpose certificate.   
4.5.2.  The builder sub -contracted a naval architect t o provide drawings for the hull, decks and 
superstructure of the vessel.  The d esign of engineering systems, including engine room 
ventilation and the CO2 flooding system, was carried out by the boat builder.  
4.5.3.  The survey  company (during construction) approved the design drawings of the hull, deck and 
superstructure  vessel and he also inspected the vessel at various stages of construction to 
confirm its compliance with the Maritime Rules.  
4.5.4.  Regarding  the engine room CO 2 flooding arrangement , the surveyor inspected and tested the 
components of the CO2 flooding system .  The components of the CO2 system operated 
correctly and complied with the Maritime Rules .  However, the vessel  was constructed with at 
least two ducts into the engine room that were  not possible to close or seal in the event of a 
fire.  The surveyor was unaware  of this  route for CO 2 to escape and fresh air to enter the 
engine  room.  The owner had subsequently sealed one of the duct vents to stop sea -water 
ingress.  
4.5.5.  It could not be established whether the openings that allowed smoke to escape from the 
engine room into the galley had always been present or were the result of subsequent 
maintenance work.  The routing of cables and pipework between adjacent compartments is a 
common caus e of the fire integrity of compartments being compromised.   It is important that 
this is considered by people and organisations involved in the design, installation and use of 
any fixed fire -fighting systems . 
4.5.6.  The construction arrangement demonstrated limit ed appreciation  of a critical feature of CO 2 
flooding systems.   

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -201 4.6. Training  
Safety issue : the operator  and crew of the PeeJay V  did not  fully appreciate the principles 
underlying how a fixed fire -fighting CO2 flooding systems  works .  
4.6.1.  At interview i t was apparent that the crew and operators of the PeeJay V  did not fully 
appreciate the importance of completely sealing  the engine room before activating the CO2 
system  to extinguish the fire. Although they were aware that at least one  duct could not be 
closed they did  not consider  this to be a serious threat .   
4.6.2.  Their training and understanding of th e system was limited to  the instructions printed on a 
notice in the cupboard alongside the trigger ing mechanism  (see Figure 4). The emergency 
procedure instructions  stated : 
 Check no -one is in the engine space  
 PASSENGERS out  
 Close AIR FLAPS  
 Shut FUEL OFF   
 Release the CO2. 
 
4.6.3.  The emergency procedure for a fire in the engine room, which the crew followed, was 
described in the Boat Work Manual.  It was basically  the same procedure as that given in the 
cupboard of the triggering mechanism.  
 
Figure 5

4.6.4.  The PeeJay V’s operator and crew training in cluded fire drills on  board the vessel, and they 
attended the local fire station to receive training and gain experience using fire extinguishers. 
However , the training on the CO2 flooding system was limited .  Consequently , the principle s 
underlying how the CO2 system worked w ere not well understood.  Had they had a better 
appreciation for the principles of the CO 2 system it is more likely they would have understood 
the critical need for the compartment to be fully closed down .  

 
Final Report MO -2016 -201 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.6.5.  However, i t is likely that even if all the fire fla ps had been closed before the CO2 was triggered , 
the fire would not have been extinguished because air was able to enter the engine room 
through the duct .  
Finding s 
2. The absence of a fire detection and alarm system on  the PeeJay V  meant the 
crew had less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life -
saving apparatus . 
3. The construction  of the engine room did not allow the compartment to be fully 
sealed , which rendered the C O2 fixed fire -fighting system ineffective .   
4. The crew were not sufficiently familiar with the principles of the C O2 fixed fire -
fighting system for the engine room , which meant they lacked the knowledge 
to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire . 
 
4.7. Abandon ship  
4.7.1.  On this occasion , the PeeJay V  was in the sheltered waters of Whakatāne River entrance and 
close to assistance when the passengers and crew had to abandon ship, some without 
wearing a life -jacket.  Had the accident occurred further off -shore those passengers without 
life-jackets would have been exposed to a significantly increased  risk. 
4.7.2.  In the event , the evacuation of passengers to their muster areas on the flybridge and foredeck 
was conducted by the crew decisively and efficiently .  Likewise , the crew maintai ned good 
control of the situation during the transfer of passengers across to the assisting vessels.  
4.7.3.  However , due to the fire blocking access to where the life -jackets were stowed they were 
unable to  access most of them  on board and distribute them to the passengers .  
4.7.4.  Maritime Rule 40A requires , life-jackets must be stowed in locations approved by a surveyor 
and must be readily accessible to persons on  board in an emergency.  Life-jackets on  board 
the PeeJay V  were distributed between the forward cabin, the  flybridge deck and the lazarette , 
with most  stored in the forward cabin.  
4.7.5.  Access to the forward cabin was via an internal companionway  down from the main cabin, or 
by climbing down through a hatch in the foredeck. The internal companionway and forward 
cabin was quickly  filled by smoke  and the crew did not have an opportunity to access the life -
jackets .  The crew faced similar conditions in the area of the lazarette and f or the same 
reason s were unable to access the life -jackets stowed there.   
4.7.6.  The life -jacket stowage on board  the PeeJay V  was approved by the surveyor, and reasonably 
so. Although not required under the Maritime Rules , life-jackets were distributed around the 
vessel in three separate locations in an attempt to mitigate the risk from one location 
becoming inaccessible . 
4.7.7.  There will always be an element of risk, w herever life -jackets are stowed , that they may 
become inaccessib le in the event of an emergency .  In this accident a fire made the main and 
forward cabin inaccessible. The i mplication is that t he life -jackets could have been stored 
elsew here , but given th e need to keep them protected from the elements and readily 
accessible the options available on a vessel the size of  the PeeJay V  were  limited.   
4.7.8.  Maritime Rule 40A requires that, liferafts or buoyancy apparatus must be stowed so that they 
can be readily placed in the water on either side of the ship. The Carley  float was sto wed on 
the roof of the flybridge from where  it could be launched on either side of the ship.  However , 
the crew were unable to access the roof of the flybridge due to the fire and smoke  and 

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Report MO -2016 -201 therefore a vital piece of life -saving equipment, particularly for those passengers without life -
jackets, was not available . 
4.7.9.  This accident demonstrates the difficulty sm all boat operators face when deciding where to 
stow fire -fighting and life -saving apparatus to be readily available in any foreseeable event.  
There was no fault in the way the operator distributed the life -saving apparatus on board the 
PeeJay V .  The fire  simply took hold too fast for the crew to make full use of all of the life -
jackets and the Carley float.  
4.7.10.  The accident is also a good demonst ration of how important it is to have systems for the early 
detection and suppression of emerging problems, leaving  the crew with more options for 
responding to the situation in accordance with a pre -defined response plan.  
Finding  
5. Although t he placement and storage of the lifesaving equipment on board the 
PeeJay V  was well thought out, the speed with which the fire obstructed 
access meant a high percentage of the life -jackets and the Carley float could 
not be accessed .

 5. Findings  
5.1. The Commission determined that the fire likely started in the engine room.  However , the 
Commission has not been able to determine the cause of the fire.    
5.2. The absence of a fire detection and alarm system on  the PeeJay V  meant the crew had less 
time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life -saving apparatus . 
5.3. The construction of the engine room did not allow the compartme nt to be fully sealed, which 
rendered the C O2 fixed fire -fighting system ineffective.   
5.4. The crew were not sufficiently familiar with the principles of the C O2 fixed fire -fighting system

5.5. Although the placement and storage of the life -saving equipment on board the PeeJay V  was 
well thought out, the speed with which the fire obstructed access meant a high percentage of 
the life -jackets and the Carley f loat could not be accessed.

 Final Report MO -2016 -201 6. Safety issues  
6.1. The Maritime Rules did not require the PeeJay V  to have fire detection or automatic fire alarms 
installed even though it could carry up to 90 passengers and operate up to 12 nm from the 
coast . 
6.2. The CO 2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine room could not be fully effective in 
extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed down.  
6.3. The builder and operators of the vessel did not fully appreciate the pr inciples of how the CO2 
fixed fire -fighting system operated.

 7. Safety a ctions  
General  
7.1. The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation,  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
7.2. The owner of the PeeJay V  operated another vessel with a similar arrangement for the forced 
draft fan into the engine room. The owner installed a closing mechanism so the fire flap on 
that f orced draft fan could be closed remotely without having to enter the vessel.     
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
7.3. None .

 Final Report MO -2016 -201 8. Recommendations  
General  
8.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case, recommendations have been issued to [insert orga nisations], with notice 
of these recommendations given to [insert organisations].  
8.2. In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Previous recommendations  
8.3. Maritime Rules did not require the PeeJay V  to have fire detection or automatic fire alarms 
installed even though it could carry up to 90 passengers and operate up to 12 nm from the 
coast . 
The Commission determined that the fire likely started in the engine room of the PeeJay V . The 
very likely absence of an alarm system on  the PeeJay V  meant the crew had less time and 
opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life -saving apparatus.  
In 2003 , the Commission published a report concerning a fire in the engine room of a 20 m 
long passenger vessel.  That investigation, and subsequent  discussion with the Maritime 
Safety Agency ,6 resulted in a recommendation (033/03) to the Director of the Maritime Safety 
Agency that:  
When conducting any review of maritime rule part 40A (Design and Equipment – 
Passenger Ships SOLAS) undertake a cost be nefit analysis to consider any 
existing restricted limit passenger ships with totally enclosed engine spaces to be 
fitted with a fire detection system and a remotely operated fire extinguishing 
system in the engine space.  
Where a cost benefit is demonstrat ed as positive, consider drafting an 
amendment to maritime rule part 40A for the Minister’s consideration.  
Any amendment of the rule to be phased so that existing passenger vessels 
above 15m, or carrying more than 36 passengers to be fi tted with this equip ment 
first.  
Currently , the recommendation remains with an open status.  Since the recommendation was 
made , Maritime Rules Part Rule 40A remains unchanged with respect to mandatory fire 
detection and automatic fire alarms on restricted -limits vessels.  The matter is on MNZ ’s policy 
issue register, and is due to be considered as part of the comprehensive review of the 
Maritime Rules Part Rule 40 for 2017/18 . 
The safety issue that this recommendation was to address is equally applicable to this 
accident, and it is virtually certain that it will arise again in the future unless it is addressed.   
Therefore the Commission invites the Director o f Maritime New Zeal and to implement this 
recommendation as part of the 2017/18 review of Rule Part 40 . 
On 17 January 2018, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
At the time recommendation 033/03 was originally issued, MNZ was 
required to demonstrate that a regulatory change would me et a prescribed 
cost-benefit ratio before it could proceed.  At that time, MNZ determined the 
change did not meet that threshold.  While there is no longer a requirement 
to meet a prescribed cost -benefit ratio, in light of the PeeJay V incident, MNZ 
will:

 1. Undertake an appropriate cost -benefit analysis of the proposal as part of 
its wider review of the 40 series of Maritime Rules  
2. If the cost -benefit analysis supports regulatory intervention, MNZ will 
recommend appropriate rule amendment(s) to the Minister to  consider.  
3. MNZ will ensure that any proposed amendments are prioritised 
according to the safety risks which those amendments intend to 
address.  
The scoping for the review of the 40 series is due for completion within the 
next 6 -12 months.  The actual amend ments will be sequenced over multiple 
years, beginning in the 2018/19 financial year.  I foresee that MNZ will 
conclude its response to recommendation 033/03 during this period.  
I will keep the Commission informed of progress on this matter.  
New recommendation  
8.4. The CO 2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine room of the PeeJay V  was not fully 
effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting was not, and could not, 
be fully closed down.  
When the CO2 system was tri ggered it did suppress the fire, but only for a few minutes.  The 
reason for this was there was four ways for fresh air to enter the engine room after the CO2 
had been injected into the compartment.  
The construction of the engine room did not allow the com partment to be fully sealed, which 
rendered the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system ineffective.   
The crew were not sufficiently familiar with the principles of the CO 2 fixed fire -fighting system 
for the engine room , which meant they lacked the knowledge to en sure the integrity of the 
system before and during the fire . 
The Commission recommends to the Director of MNZ  that he promotes the need for people 
and organisations involved in the design, installation and use of any fixed fire -fighting systems 
to fully document and understand the principles and operation of those systems. ( 035/17)  
8.5. On 17 January 2018, Maritime Ne w Zealand replied:  
I accept this recommendation.  Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) will communicate 
directly with surveyors and other relevant persons to promote this need over the 
coming 12 months.

 Final Report MO -2016 -201 9. Key l essons  
9.1. Early detection of a fire on board a vessel is critical to a successful fire -fighting response and 
for the early preparation of life -saving apparel and equipment.  
9.2. Crew must be fully familiar with and trained in the use of fire -fighting systems on board, 
otherwise the systems might not be of any use in fighting a fire.  
9.3. Even if a f ixed Co 2 fire-fighting apparatus is fully functional, it will only be effective in fighting a 
fire if  the design of the space it is protecting can be fully closed off .
