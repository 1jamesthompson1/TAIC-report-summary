  \ vessel used to take  tourists  from Whakat\u0101ne to White Island \nand back.\
  \  During a return voyage a catastrophic fire took hold  and the vessel burned to\
  \ the \nwaterline and sank .  All passengers and crew abandoned the vessel and were\
  \ recovered  \nwithout significant injury . \n4.1.2.  The vessel was designed and\
  \ built specifically for the type of operation it was engaged in on \nthe day of\
  \ the accident.  MNZ had issued the operator with a Maritime Transport Operators\
  \ \nCertificate, but had not yet conducted the initial  audit  scheduled for t he\
  \ following year .  \n4.1.3.  The Commission identified three safety issues relat\
  \ ing to the implementation of the vessel 's \nsafety management system and the\
  \ fire detection and extinguishing system on board :   \n\uF0B7  the PeeJay V could\
  \ carry  up to 90 passengers and operat e up to 12 nm from the coast , \nand ve\
  \ ry likely  did not  have fire detection or automatic fire alarms installed  \n\
  \uF0B7 the CO2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine  room could \
  \ not be fully effective \nin extinguishing  the fire  because the space it was\
  \ protecting could not be fully closed \ndown  \n\uF0B7 the builder and operators\
  \ of the vessel did not  fully appreciate the principles of how the \nCO2 fixed\
  \ fir e-fighting  system  operated.  \n4.2. Source of ignition  and location of\
  \ the fire \n4.2.1.  The fire con sumed the entire vessel down to the waterline,\
  \ at which point it sank.  \nConsequently , there was very little physical evidence\
  \ remaining  and the Commission was \nunable to conclusively establish the cause\
  \ of the fire . \n4.2.2.  The first sign of smoke came from within the galley cabinets\
  \  above the engine  room , and later \nthick smoke was seen flowing from the engine\
  \ room vents.  It is very likely  therefore that the \nfire started in the engine\
  \ room.  \n4.2.3.  The underwater survey of the wreck showed the charring in the\
  \ timber hull was deepest in the \nforward starboard area of the engine  room. \
  \ Depth of charring is one indica tor of how long a \nfire has burnt  for.  However,\
  \ it can also be an indicator of the intensity of the fire in that area.  \nFactors\
  \ affecting the intensity of a fire i nclude the supply of air to the space and\
  \ the \ncombustibility of materials in the area.   \n4.2.4.  Most of the  electrical\
  \ installations and systems  were located in the starboard forward area of \nthe\
  \ engine room , but so too was  the hydraulic tank for the steering syst em.  Electrical\
  \ systems \nare a common cause of fires on small vessels.  However, o nce ignited,\
  \ hydraulic oil is known \nto burn with intensity , which could be one explanation\
  \ for the deeper charring in the area.   The \ndeeper charring in that area was\
  \ therefore  not necessarily proof that the fire originated in that \narea.  \n\n\
  << Page 10 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -201  \nFigure 4 \nComposit e image of the\
  \ forward starboard area of  the PeeJay V  engine  room  (from survey records) \
  \ \n4.2.5.  There are a number of other common causes of fire.  Ruptured  high pressure\
  \ fuel lines can \nspray fuel onto hot surfaces .  However, the fuel lines on the\
  \ PeeJay V's  engine were effectively \nenclosed within the engine  and the lines\
  \ from the  main  fuel tank entered at its aft end.  \n4.2.6.  Engine exhaust failure\
  \ direct ing hot exha ust gas onto a flammable material  is another \npotential\
  \ cause .  However,  the exhaust system was located at the aft end of the engine\
  \ room.  \n4.2.7.  The main batte ries were  situated approximately mid -point on\
  \ the starboard side of the engine \nroom .  It was not possibl e to establish what\
  \ level of electrical protection was built into the \nsystem to prevent a short\
  \ circuit from causing a fire.  \n4.2.8.  Spontaneous or assisted combustion of\
  \ oily rags  and detritus  is another known cause o f fires.  \nHowever,  the engine\
  \ room was known to have been kept in a clean and tidy state .   \nFinding  \n1.\
  \ The Commission determined that the fire likely started in the  engine room.  \n\
  However , the Commission has not been  able to determine the cause of the \nfire.\
  \ \n \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -201 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.3.  Fire detection  \n\
  Safety issue: a vessel  certified to carry up to 90 passengers  and operating up\
  \ to 12 nm from \nthe coast very likely did not  have fire detection  equipment\
  \  or automatic  fire alarms installed . \n4.3.1.  Maritime Rules Part 19 Maritime\
  \ Transport Operator - Certification and Responsibilities. The \npurpose of Part\
  \ 19 is to require maritime transport operators to develop, and operate in \naccordance\
  \ with, safety systems that are specific and appropriate to their maritime transport\
  \ \noperation. The Maritime Transpor t Operator Safety System is known as MOSS and\
  \ is regulated \nby MNZ . \n4.3.2.  To enter MOSS, the operator must develop a Maritime\
  \ Transport Operator Plan (MTOP) and \nsubmit it for a desktop review and site visit\
  \ by MNZ .  When MNZ  are satisfied the MTOP \ncomplies with P art 19 , they issue\
  \ a Maritime Transport Operators Certificate (MTOC) to the \noperator.  The maritime\
  \ rules require that the MTOP ensures:  \n\uF0B7 19.42 1 (a) ; identify and manage\
  \ the safety risks involved in the maritime transport \noperation '. \n\uF0B7 19.42\
  \ 2 (c) ; Address 'all reasonably foreseeable hazards associated with the\u2026\
  \ \noperation '. \n4.3.3.  There are effectively two steps to achieving those requirements.\
  \ The first step is to identify the \nrisks to the operation and develop controls\
  \ for those risks.  For example, the operator h ad \nidentified that fire in the\
  \ engine room was a risk, and hence the safety management system \nincluded a specific\
  \ emergency procedure for that risk (see Appendix 1 Emergency procedures \nfor fire).\
  \  \n4.3.4.  The second step is to continuously monitor and review the op eration\
  \ for emerging risks or \nsafety hazards.  \n4.3.5.  The PeeJay V  was built subject\
  \ to Rule 40A which required that surfaces and materials of the \nengine room had\
  \ 'low flame spread', 'fire -resisting' or 'non -combustible' properties.  The use\
  \ \nof such materials gave  more time to detect and fight a fire.  It is not known\
  \ how long th is fire \nhad been burning in the engine compartment before smoke\
  \ was first observed in the galley.  \nThe first i ndication  of the fire was when\
  \ the crew members standing adjacent to t he galley  \nsmelt fumes .  Because the\
  \ source of the fire could not be determined, it is not known whether \nthe fire\
  \ had been building for some time or whether the onset was rapid . \n4.3.6.  There\
  \ was a heat detector  with a flashing light  fitted in the engine  room, but it\
  \ was no t \nconnected to an alarm and hence was of limited benefit.   Nobody could\
  \ recall  whether any \nother form of fire detection and automatic alarm system\
  \ was installed on the vessel.  There \nwas nothing recorded in the vessel 's documentation\
  \  or maintenance plan and records, nor in \nthe survey records .  The survey checklist\
  \ was notated 'not applicable' against the item fire \ndetectors and automatic fire\
  \ alarms. T he crew were not aware of any detection  and automatic \nalarm panel\
  \ in the wheelhouse.   It is therefore very unlikely that any form of useful fire\
  \ \ndetection and alarm system was installed on the vessel.  \n4.3.7.  Maritime\
  \ Rules do not require fire detection or automatic fire alarms to be fitted o n\
  \ board a \nrestricted -limits4 vessel less than 24  metres (m) , such as the PeeJay\
  \ V .  If the  vessel had been \nover 24  m in length maritime rules would require\
  \  fire detection and automatic fire alarms to \nhave been installed , regardless\
  \ of how many people it was permitted to carry.  Yet being under \n24 m meant that\
  \ no s uch a system was required . \n4.3.8.  Maritime rules are minimum standards\
  \ that must be met , but operators can install a greater \nlevel of safety commensurate\
  \ with the risk involved.  Risk is a function of consequence and \nthe likelihood\
  \ of an accident happening.  The consequence of a fire in the engine room of a \n\
  passenger vessel is significant and the likelihood potentially greater than  for\
  \ some  other areas \nof the vessel.  \n                                       \
  \                 \n4 Restricted limits means enclosed water limits and inshore\
  \ water limits.  \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -201 4.3.9.  Safety management\
  \ systems require operators to identify all of the hazards involved with their \n\
  operation, and either eliminate or mitigate the hazard to reduce the risk to as\
  \ low as \nreasonably practicable.  \n4.3.10.  The operator's hazard register focused\
  \ mainly on personal injury , such as slips , trips and falls, \nand gave limited\
  \ consideration to fire and other c atastrophic events. The only mention of fire\
  \ \nin the hazard register was the spontaneous combustion of dirty rags in the engine\
  \ room . \n4.3.11.  In 2003 , the Commission published a report concerning a fire\
  \ in the engine  room of a 20  m \nlong passenger vessel.  That inve stigation ,\
  \ and subsequent discussion with the Maritime \nSafety Agency ,5 resulted in a \
  \ recommendation  (033/03)  to the Director of the Maritime Safety \nAgency that:\
  \  \nWhen conducting any review of maritime rule part 40A (Design and Equipment\
  \ - \nPassenger Ships S OLAS) undertake a cost benefit analysis to consider any\
  \ \nexisting restricted limit passenger ships with totally enclosed engine spaces\
  \ to be \nfitted with a fire detection system and a remotely operated fire extinguishing\
  \ \nsystem in the engine space.  \nWhere a c ost benefit is demonstrated as positive,\
  \ consider drafting an \namendment to maritime rule part 40A for the Minister's\
  \ consideration.  \nAny amendment of the rule to be phased so that existing passenger\
  \ vessels \nabove 15m, or carrying more than 36 passengers to be fitted with this\
  \ equipment \nfirst.  \n4.3.12.  Although automatic fire alarms were not specifically\
  \ mentioned in the above recommendation, \nit logically follows that any fire detection\
  \ system should incorporate an automatic alarm \nsystem.  Since the recommendation\
  \ was  made Maritime Rules Part Rule 40A remains \nunchanged with respect to mandatory\
  \ fire detection and automatic fire alarms on restricted -\nlimits vessels.   The\
  \ recommendation is applicable to this accident as well.  Currently , the \nrecommendation\
  \ remains with an  open status.  Consequently,  the Commission has not \nrepeated\
  \ the recommendation , but draws the Director 's attention to the safety issue and\
  \ \ninvites his further consideration of the issue in the interests of maritime\
  \ transport safety . \n4.3.13.  The matter is on M NZ's policy issue register, and\
  \ is due to be considered as part of the \ncomprehensive review of the Maritime\
  \ Rules Part Rule 40 for 2017/18.    \n4.4. Fighting the fire \nSafety issue: the\
  \ CO2 fixed fire -fighting system installed in the engine  room could  not be fully\
  \ \neffective in extinguishing  the fire  because the space it was protecting could\
  \ not be fully closed \ndown.  \n4.4.1.  Fire is a chain reaction of rapid oxidation\
  \ of a material  and it requires three ingredients to \ncontinue: heat, fuel and\
  \ oxygen.  If one of the ingredient s is removed the fire will be \nextinguished.\
  \  A CO2 flooding system is designed to displace the oxygen within a compartment\
  \  \nand thus extinguish any fire within that space.   It is a fire -fighting system\
  \ commonly used in a \nvessel 's engine  room.  \n4.4.2.  A CO2 flooding  system\
  \ consist s of liquid CO2 stored in gas cylinders, a manual triggering \nmechanism,\
  \ and a valve and pipe arrangement distribut ing CO2 from the cylinder into the\
  \ \nengine room.   The CO2 cylinders and the manual triggering mechanism are located\
  \ outside the \ncompartment they were  designed to protect.   \n4.4.3.  The integrity\
  \ of a CO2 flooding system in subduing a fire is dependent on depriving the fire\
  \ of \noxygen.   For the CO2 flooding system to work effectively , it follows that\
  \ the compartment must \nbe impervious to the escape of CO 2, or to the re-entry\
  \ of air.  This outcome is embodied in the \nMaritime Rules Part 42B.20 (4) [with\
  \ respect to CO2 flooding systems] , 'Means must be \nprovided to close all openings\
  \ that ma y admit or allow gas to escape from a protected space '.  \nA CO2 flooding\
  \ system will only work effectively if the c ompartment  has been sealed  by closing\
  \ \n                                                        \n5 The Maritime Safety\
  \ Agency was renamed Maritime New Z ealand in 1993.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016\
  \ -201 \n<< Page 13 >>\n all doors , ducts  and vents and then manually triggering\
  \ the system and inject ing CO2 into th e \ncompartmen t.  \n4.4.4.  The engine\
  \ room of the PeeJay V  was designed with a ventilation system to supply air for\
  \ the \nengines. The ventilation system included a forced draft fan to force  air\
  \ into the engine  room. \nThere was also a set of passive ducts which vented the\
  \ engine room to the atmosphere.  \n4.4.5.  The passive ducts were fitted with flaps\
  \ which could be closed in the event of a fire .  The \nforced draft fan could be\
  \ turned off remotely and also had a flap which could be closed . \n4.4.6.  When\
  \ the CO2 system was triggered it did suppress t he fire , but only for a few minutes.\
  \   The \nreason for this was there were at least four ways for fresh air to enter\
  \ the engine room after \nthe CO2 had been injected into the compartment : \n\uF0B7\
  \ one of the engine room ventilation flaps was closed some  time after the  CO2\
  \ system \nhad been triggered  \n\uF0B7 the master turned off the power to the forced\
  \ draft fan when the fire was first \ndiscovered, but the crew were not able to\
  \ close the fire flap over the duct as the  \nclosing mechanism was located within\
  \ the lazarette  \n\uF0B7 during interview s the operators acknowledged a duct,\
  \ or ducts,  that ran from the \nengine room  and vented to the atmosphere but did\
  \ not have any method of clos ure \n\uF0B7 smoke from the engine room was seen flowing\
  \ out from the galley cabinets  located \nabove the engine room , but if it  could\
  \ flow out from the engine room then air could \nflow in.  \n4.4.7.  Two of the\
  \ four means for fresh air to enter the engine room were related to construction\
  \ and \ntwo to crew training  \n4.5. Construction  \n4.5.1.  The boat builder had\
  \ built two vessels for the owner pr ior to the PeeJay V .  The contract for \n\
  PeeJay V  was for the builder to manage the project, design and build the vessel.\
  \ The owner \nwould take delivery of a completed vessel with a Fit -For-Purpose\
  \ certificate.   \n4.5.2.  The builder sub -contracted a naval architect t o provide\
  \ drawings for the hull, decks and \nsuperstructure of the vessel.  The d esign\
  \ of engineering systems, including engine room \nventilation and the CO2 flooding\
  \ system, was carried out by the boat builder.  \n4.5.3.  The survey  company (during\
  \ construction) approved the design drawings of the hull, deck and \nsuperstructure\
  \  vessel and he also inspected the vessel at various stages of construction to\
  \ \nconfirm its compliance with the Maritime Rules.  \n4.5.4.  Regarding  the engine\
  \ room CO 2 flooding arrangement , the surveyor inspected and tested the \ncomponents\
  \ of the CO2 flooding system .  The components of the CO2 system operated \ncorrectly\
  \ and complied with the Maritime Rules .  However, the vessel  was constructed with\
  \ at \nleast two ducts into the engine room that were  not possible to close or\
  \ seal in the event of a \nfire.  The surveyor was unaware  of this  route for CO\
  \ 2 to escape and fresh air to enter the \nengine  room.  The owner had subsequently\
  \ sealed one of the duct vents to stop sea -water \ningress.  \n4.5.5.  It could\
  \ not be established whether the openings that allowed smoke to escape from the\
  \ \nengine room into the galley had always been present or were the result of subsequent\
  \ \nmaintenance work.  The routing of cables and pipework between adjacent compartments\
  \ is a \ncommon caus e of the fire integrity of compartments being compromised.\
  \   It is important that \nthis is considered by people and organisations involved\
  \ in the design, installation and use of \nany fixed fire -fighting systems . \n\
  4.5.6.  The construction arrangement demonstrated limit ed appreciation  of a critical\
  \ feature of CO 2 \nflooding systems.   \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2016\
  \ -201 4.6. Training  \nSafety issue : the operator  and crew of the PeeJay V  did\
  \ not  fully appreciate the principles \nunderlying how a fixed fire -fighting CO2\
  \ flooding systems  works .  \n4.6.1.  At interview i t was apparent that the crew\
  \ and operators of the PeeJay V  did not fully \nappreciate the importance of completely\
  \ sealing  the engine room before activating the CO2 \nsystem  to extinguish the\
  \ fire. Although they were aware that at least one  duct could not be \nclosed they\
  \ did  not consider  this to be a serious threat .   \n4.6.2.  Their training and\
  \ understanding of th e system was limited to  the instructions printed on a \n\
  notice in the cupboard alongside the trigger ing mechanism  (see Figure 4). The\
  \ emergency \nprocedure instructions  stated : \n\uF0B7 Check no -one is in the\
  \ engine space  \n\uF0B7 PASSENGERS out  \n\uF0B7 Close AIR FLAPS  \n\uF0B7 Shut\
  \ FUEL OFF   \n\uF0B7 Release the CO2. \n \n4.6.3.  The emergency procedure for\
  \ a fire in the engine room, which the crew followed, was \ndescribed in the Boat\
  \ Work Manual.  It was basically  the same procedure as that given in the \ncupboard\
  \ of the triggering mechanism.  \n \nFigure 5 \nCO 2 locker showing the CO 2 bottle\
  \ and its instructions for use  \n4.6.4.  The PeeJay V's operator and crew training\
  \ in cluded fire drills on  board the vessel, and they \nattended the local fire\
  \ station to receive training and gain experience using fire extinguishers. \nHowever\
  \ , the training on the CO2 flooding system was limited .  Consequently , the principle\
  \ s \nunderlying how the CO2 system worked w ere not well understood.  Had they\
  \ had a better \nappreciation for the principles of the CO 2 system it is more likely\
  \ they would have understood \nthe critical need for the compartment to be fully\
  \ closed down .  \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -201 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.6.5.  However,\
  \ i t is likely that even if all the fire fla ps had been closed before the CO2\
  \ was triggered , \nthe fire would not have been extinguished because air was able\
  \ to enter the engine room \nthrough the duct .  \nFinding s \n2. The absence of\
  \ a fire detection and alarm system on  the PeeJay V  meant the \ncrew had less\
  \ time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life -\nsaving apparatus\
  \ . \n3. The construction  of the engine room did not allow the compartment to be\
  \ fully \nsealed , which rendered the C O2 fixed fire -fighting system ineffective\
  \ .   \n4. The crew were not sufficiently familiar with the principles of the C\
  \ O2 fixed fire -\nfighting system for the engine room , which meant they lacked\
  \ the knowledge \nto ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire\
  \ . \n \n4.7. Abandon ship  \n4.7.1.  On this occasion , the PeeJay V  was in the\
  \ sheltered waters of Whakat\u0101ne River entrance and \nclose to assistance when\
  \ the passengers and crew had to abandon ship, some without \nwearing a life -jacket.\
  \  Had the accident occurred further off -shore those passengers without \nlife-jackets\
  \ would have been exposed to a significantly increased  risk. \n4.7.2.  In the event\
  \ , the evacuation of passengers to their muster areas on the flybridge and foredeck\
  \ \nwas conducted by the crew decisively and efficiently .  Likewise , the crew\
  \ maintai ned good \ncontrol of the situation during the transfer of passengers\
  \ across to the assisting vessels.  \n4.7.3.  However , due to the fire blocking\
  \ access to where the life -jackets were stowed they were \nunable to  access most\
  \ of them  on board and distribute them to the passengers .  \n4.7.4.  Maritime\
  \ Rule 40A requires , life-jackets must be stowed in locations approved by a surveyor\
  \ \nand must be readily accessible to persons on  board in an emergency.  Life-jackets\
  \ on  board \nthe PeeJay V  were distributed between the forward cabin, the  flybridge\
  \ deck and the lazarette , \nwith most  stored in the forward cabin.  \n4.7.5. \
  \ Access to the forward cabin was via an internal companionway  down from the main\
  \ cabin, or \nby climbing down through a hatch in the foredeck. The internal companionway\
  \ and forward \ncabin was quickly  filled by smoke  and the crew did not have an\
  \ opportunity to access the life -\njackets .  The crew faced similar conditions\
  \ in the area of the lazarette and f or the same \nreason s were unable to access\
  \ the life -jackets stowed there.   \n4.7.6.  The life -jacket stowage on board\
  \  the PeeJay V  was approved by the surveyor, and reasonably \nso. Although not\
  \ required under the Maritime Rules , life-jackets were distributed around the \n\
  vessel in three separate locations in an attempt to mitigate the risk from one location\
  \ \nbecoming inaccessible . \n4.7.7.  There will always be an element of risk, w\
  \ herever life -jackets are stowed , that they may \nbecome inaccessib le in the\
  \ event of an emergency .  In this accident a fire made the main and \nforward cabin\
  \ inaccessible. The i mplication is that t he life -jackets could have been stored\
  \ \nelsew here , but given th e need to keep them protected from the elements and\
  \ readily \naccessible the options available on a vessel the size of  the PeeJay\
  \ V  were  limited.   \n4.7.8.  Maritime Rule 40A requires that, liferafts or buoyancy\
  \ apparatus must be stowed so that they \ncan be readily placed in the water on\
  \ either side of the ship. The Carley  float was sto wed on \nthe roof of the flybridge\
  \ from where  it could be launched on either side of the ship.  However , \nthe\
  \ crew were unable to access the roof of the flybridge due to the fire and smoke\
  \  and \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report MO -2016 -201 therefore a vital piece of\
  \ life -saving equipment, particularly for those passengers without life -\njackets,\
  \ was not available . \n4.7.9.  This accident demonstrates the difficulty sm all\
  \ boat operators face when deciding where to \nstow fire -fighting and life -saving\
  \ apparatus to be readily available in any foreseeable event.  \nThere was no fault\
  \ in the way the operator distributed the life -saving apparatus on board the \n\
  PeeJay V .  The fire  simply took hold too fast for the crew to make full use of\
  \ all of the life -\njackets and the Carley float.  \n4.7.10.  The accident is also\
  \ a good demonst ration of how important it is to have systems for the early \n\
  detection and suppression of emerging problems, leaving  the crew with more options\
  \ for \nresponding to the situation in accordance with a pre -defined response plan.\
  \  \nFinding  \n5. Although t he placement and storage of the lifesaving equipment\
  \ on board the \nPeeJay V  was well thought out, the speed with which the fire obstructed\
  \ \naccess meant a high percentage of the life -jackets and the Carley float could\
  \ \nnot be accessed . \n \n  \n \nFinal Report MO -2016 -201 \n<< Page 17 >>"
