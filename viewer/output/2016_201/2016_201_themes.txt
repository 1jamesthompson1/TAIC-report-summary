Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Lack of fire detection and alarm system: The absence of a fire detection and alarm system on the vessel meant that the crew had less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life-saving apparatus. This lack of early warning system significantly impacted their ability to mitigate the fire effectively.

2. Ineffective CO2 fixed fire-fighting system: The construction of the engine room did not allow for the compartment to be fully sealed, rendering the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system ineffective. The system was unable to fully suppress the fire due to the continuous influx of fresh air into the engine room, limiting its ability to displace oxygen and extinguish the fire.

3. Insufficient knowledge and training: The crew of the vessel did not fully appreciate the principles underlying how the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system worked. Their training and understanding of the system were limited, leading to a lack of knowledge in ensuring the integrity of the system before and during the fire. This lack of understanding hindered their ability to effectively utilize the fire-fighting system.

4. Inaccessibility of life-saving equipment: The fire obstructed access to the life-saving equipment, including life-jackets and the Carley float. The placement and storage of the equipment were well thought out, but the speed at which the fire spread made it difficult for the crew to access and distribute the life-saving apparatus to the passengers. This hindered their ability to ensure the safety of the passengers in a timely manner.
