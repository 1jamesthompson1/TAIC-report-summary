","0.0","5.0","While the document does not explicitly mention communication failures as a direct cause, it does highlight issues with crew training and understanding of the CO2 system, which could be related to crew resource management.

","0.0","20.0","The crew's lack of understanding of the CO2 fire-fighting system's principles and the importance of sealing the engine room before activation indicates inadequate training and preparedness for emergency procedures. ""The crew and operators of the PeeJay V did not fully appreciate the importance of completely sealing the engine room before activating the CO2 system"" (4.6.1).
","0.0","0.0","The document does not provide evidence that maintenance procedures and compliance were a factor in the accident. There is no mention of maintenance issues contributing to the fire or the failure of systems.
","0.0","26.667","The absence of a fire detection and alarm system significantly contributed to the accident by reducing the crew's time to respond. ""The absence of a fire detection and alarm system on the PeeJay V meant the crew had less time and opportunity to respond to the fire"" (5.2). Additionally, the CO2 fire-fighting system's ineffectiveness due to the engine room not being fully sealed was a major safety issue. ""The construction of the engine room did not allow the compartment to be fully sealed, which rendered the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system ineffective"" (5.3).
","2.887","10.0","The vessel's lack of fire detection equipment and automatic fire alarms, despite being certified to carry up to 90 passengers, points to issues with regulatory compliance and safety management. ""A vessel certified to carry up to 90 passengers and operating up to 12 nm from the coast very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed"" (4.3).
","0.0","0.0","There is no specific mention of situational awareness or its failure as a contributing factor to the accident within the document.
","0.0","15.0","The design of the vessel, specifically the engine room's inability to be fully sealed and the lack of fire detection and suppression systems, contributed to the accident.

","0.0","5.0","The crew's response to the fire and the evacuation of passengers were decisive and efficient, suggesting that emergency response planning and coordination were not major contributing factors. However, the inability to access life-saving equipment due to the fire suggests some deficiencies.
