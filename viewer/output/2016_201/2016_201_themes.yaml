- name: Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
  explanation: The absence of fire detection equipment and automatic fire alarms was a significant safety issue in the accident involving the PeeJay V. The vessel, certified to carry up to 90 passengers and operating up to 12 nm from the coast, "very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed" (4.3 (invalid formatted quote)). This lack of early detection systems meant that the crew had "less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life-saving apparatus" (5.2), which is crucial in managing a fire emergency effectively and ensuring the safety of passengers and crew.
- name: CO2 Fire Suppression System Effectiveness
  explanation: The CO2 fixed fire-fighting system installed in the engine room of the PeeJay V was rendered ineffective due to the inability to fully close down the space it was protecting. The report states that "the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system installed in the engine room could not be fully effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed down" (4.1.3). This was due to several factors, including ventilation flaps that were not closed in time and other openings that allowed air to enter the engine room (4.4.6). The crew's lack of understanding of the importance of sealing the engine room before activating the CO2 system contributed to the system's ineffectiveness (4.6.1).
- name: Crew Training and Familiarity with Safety Systems
  explanation: The crew's insufficient familiarity with the principles of the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system was a contributing factor to the accident. The report indicates that the crew and operators "did not fully appreciate the principles underlying how a fixed fire-fighting co2 flooding systems works" (4.6 (invalid formatted quote)). Their training was limited to instructions printed on a notice and did not encompass a comprehensive understanding of the system's operation (4.6.2). This lack of knowledge meant they were unable to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire (5.4).
- name: Engine Room Construction and Integrity
  explanation: The construction of the engine room did not allow for it to be fully sealed, which was a critical factor in the failure of the CO2 fire suppression system. The engine room had at least two ducts that could not be closed or sealed in the event of a fire, and the surveyor was unaware of this, which allowed CO2 to escape and fresh air to enter the engine room (4.5.4). This design flaw demonstrates "limited appreciation of a critical feature of CO2 flooding systems" (4.5.6) and directly impacted the ability to control the fire.
- name: Life-Saving Equipment Accessibility
  explanation: The placement and storage of life-saving equipment on the PeeJay V were well thought out, but the rapid spread of the fire obstructed access to most of the life-jackets and the Carley float. The report states that "the speed with which the fire obstructed access meant a high percentage of the life-jackets and the carley float could not be accessed" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). This issue highlights the importance of not only having life-saving equipment on board but also ensuring that it is accessible in all emergency scenarios.
- name: Maritime Safety Regulation Compliance
  explanation: The PeeJay V complied with existing maritime safety regulations, but the regulations did not mandate the installation of fire detection or automatic fire alarms for a vessel of its size, which was under 24 meters in length (4.3.7). This regulatory gap meant that the vessel operated without these critical safety features, which could have provided an earlier warning and more effective response to the fire. The report suggests that maritime rules are minimum standards and that operators can install a greater level of safety commensurate with the risk involved (4.3.8).
