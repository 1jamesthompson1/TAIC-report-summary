- name: Fire Detection and Alarm Systems
  explanation: Fire detection and alarm systems are critical for early identification of a fire, which allows for timely evacuation and firefighting efforts. In the case of the PeeJay V, the vessel "very likely did not have fire detection equipment or automatic fire alarms installed" (4.3 (invalid formatted quote)), which is a significant safety issue. The absence of such systems meant that "the crew had less time and opportunity to respond to the fire and prepare the life-saving apparatus" (5.2). This lack of early detection systems contributed to the severity of the incident by delaying the crew's response to the fire.
- name: CO2 Fire Suppression System Effectiveness
  explanation: The effectiveness of CO2 fire suppression systems is contingent upon the ability to seal the protected space to prevent the escape of CO2 and the re-entry of air. In this incident, the CO2 system "could not be fully effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting could not be fully closed down" (4.4). The engine room had multiple points where air could enter, such as ventilation flaps that were not closed and ducts without closure mechanisms (4.4.6). This compromised the integrity of the CO2 system and allowed the fire to reignite, demonstrating a critical safety issue in the vessel's design and firefighting preparedness.
- name: Crew Training and Familiarity with Safety Systems
  explanation: Adequate crew training and familiarity with onboard safety systems are essential for effective emergency response. The crew of the PeeJay V "did not fully appreciate the principles underlying how a fixed fire-fighting co2 flooding systems works" (4.6 (invalid formatted quote)), which is a safety issue that affected their ability to respond to the fire. Their limited understanding of the CO2 system's operation meant they "lacked the knowledge to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire" (5.4). This lack of training and understanding hindered their ability to effectively use the CO2 system to suppress the fire.
- name: Vessel Construction and Compartmentalization
  explanation: The construction of a vessel plays a crucial role in fire safety, particularly the ability to compartmentalize and contain a fire. In the PeeJay V incident, the construction of the engine room "did not allow the compartment to be fully sealed, which rendered the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system ineffective" (5.3). The presence of ducts and openings that could not be sealed compromised the fire integrity of the engine room (4.5.4). This safety issue highlights the importance of considering fire containment in the design and construction of vessels.
- name: Life-Saving Equipment Accessibility
  explanation: The accessibility of life-saving equipment is paramount during an emergency evacuation. For the PeeJay V, the speed of the fire's spread obstructed access to life-jackets and the Carley float, which "could not be accessed" (5.5 (invalid formatted quote)). The life-jackets were stored in locations that became quickly filled with smoke, preventing the crew from distributing them to passengers (4.7.5). This incident underscores the safety theme of ensuring life-saving equipment is stored in such a way that it remains accessible in all foreseeable emergencies.
- name: Regulatory Compliance and Safety Standards
  explanation: Compliance with maritime safety regulations and standards is intended to minimize the risk of accidents. However, the PeeJay V incident reveals a safety issue where "maritime rules do not require fire detection or automatic fire alarms to be fitted on board a restricted-limits vessel less than 24 metres" (4.3.7 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This regulatory gap meant that the vessel was not equipped with fire detection systems despite the significant risk posed by a fire on board. The accident highlights the need for a review and potential enhancement of maritime safety regulations to better protect passengers and crew.
