The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission  may make recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqu iries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 Executive summary  
 On 5 November 2013 the passenger and freight ferry Aratere  was in Cook Strait en-route from 
Picton to Wellington when the starboard propeller shaft fractured and the propeller was lost .  
The ship was  able to complete the trip using its port propulsion system only.  
 When the ship arrived in Wellington, divers confirmed that the starboard propeller tail shaft  
had totally fractured within its tapered section , near the forward end of the propeller.  
 New pro pellers had been fitted to the Aratere ’s existing propeller shafts as part of a larger  
project to lengthen the vessel more than two years prior to the incident.  The starboard 
propeller along with the remaining section of the tail shaft  was later recovered  from the 
seabed.  
 The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found that the shaft failed 
due to a fatigue fracture that had grown ( propagated ) through the tail shaft  to a point where it 
was unable to carry normal operating loads.  
 The fati gue crack initiated in an area of fretting on the shaft taper just inside the  bore of the 
propeller hub.  The fretting was likely to have been the result of a sub -optimal  fit of the new 
propeller onto the existing tail shaft .  Fretting and corrosion weaken ed the tail shaft and made 
it more prone to fatigue failure . 
 The Commission found that vibration from a number of potential sources and uneven thrust 
between the individual blades of the propeller  caused sufficient uniaxial bending forces to 
drive the fati gue crack through the tail shaft .  The uneven thrust was the consequence of 
minor differences in the average pitch of each blade resulting from the manufacturing 
process, but more so due to the blades being damaged while in service.  
 The Commission also found  a lack of documentation about the process of fitting the propellers 
and the final fit achieved. This is significant because the fitting of the starboard propeller 
resulted in fretting , which weakened the shaft. A recommendation has been made to the Chief 
Executive of KiwiRail to address this issue . 
 The Commission has also made a recommendation to Standards New Zealand  to forward the 
report to the  International Organi zation  for Standardization  Secretariat for its  information  and 
to consider w hether th e current standards for manufacturing large -diameter marine propellers 
are appropriate for modern , high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation 
margins.

 Conduct of the inquiry   
 On 6 November 2013 at about 0730, the Transport Accident Inves tigation Commission 
(Commission) was notified that an incident involving a passenger ferry, the Aratere , had 
occurred.  
 The Commission opened an inquiry into the occurrence under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 an d appointed an investigator in charge.   
 That day t wo investigators attended the vessel in Wellington , where  it was docked.  The 
investigators conducted interviews with the crew of the vessel and collected evidence.   
 During the next few days the investigators were involved in liaising with staff at KiwiRail 
Limited ’s ferry operations head office and collecting further evidence , including a download of 
the voyage data recorder and videos of the underwater inspections of the pr opeller shafting.  
 Further information was sourced from the propeller and power train manufacturer, the 
vessel’s classification society, metallurgists, Lloyd ’s, structural engineers and propeller 
experts.   
 On 23 April 2015  the Commission approved the draft  final report to be circulated to interested 
parties.  
 The report was distributed to 10 interested parties with a closing date for receiving 
submissions of 30 June 2015 ; on request the closing  date  was extended to 17 July 2015.  
Submissions were received fr om eight interested parties.  
 The submissions were substantial and included divergent opinions from several subject -
matter experts . 
 After receiving  submissions , the Commission sent its draft final report to the commercial arm 
of the Australian Maritime Coll ege (AMC Search)  for an independent peer review .  The 
Commission received the peer review on 25 November 2015 .  The peer review recommended 
that further work be done to resolve some of the divergent views expressed in the 
submissions.  This work was conduc ted in the ensuing months, and the report was then 
redrafted to incorporate the submissions received , AMC  Search ’s comments , and the results 
of the additional research.  
 On 27 July 2016  the Commission , considering the substantial changes made to the report,  
approved the draft report being  sent back to interested persons for further consultation . 
 The report was distributed to 1 1 interested p arties  with a closing date for receiving 
submissions of 12 September 2016 ; on request the closing date was extended to 3 0 
September 2016.  Submissions were received from four interested parties.  
 The Commission has considered in detail all submissions made and any changes as a result 
of those submissions have been included in the final report.  
 On 2 November 2016  the Commissi on approved the report for publication.   
 On 16 November the Commission received a further submission from KiwiRail  in response to  
the final safety recommendation made to KiwiRail.   
 On 24 November the Commission heard from KiwiRail on its submission and a ny changes as a 
result of the further submission have been included in the final report.

 Factual information  
 Narrative  
The day of the incident  
3.1.1.  At about 1830 o n 5 November 2013 , the rail, passenger and freight ferry Aratere  departed 
Picton on a scheduled voyage to Wellington.  There  were 39 crew and 114 passengers  on 
board .   
3.1.2.  The Aratere ’s passage through the Marlborough Sounds was uneventful and at about 1934 
the vessel was passing abeam of East Head at the entrance to Tory Channel  (see Figure 1 ).   
3.1.3.  Once clear of the Tory Channel entrance the second mate was hand ing over the control of the 
navigation to the third mate when they heard  two loud noises that reverberated through the 
ship.  
3.1.4.  The second and third mates  checked that they had not hit an object in the water .  They then 
checked the instrumentation on the bridge and noted that no alarms had registered .  
Everything appeared to be normal except that no load was registering for the starboard 
propulsion system  (that is, the propulsion system was not producing any thrust) . 
3.1.5.  The third mate  telephoned the engineer in the control room , who reported  that he knew of no 
problem  and that no alarms had registered.  The second mate  contacted the  duty master , who 
made his way to the bridge.  
3.1.6.  The chief engineer was in his office when he heard the bangs.  He c hecked  outside to  see if 
the vessel had hit anything , then returned to his office and checked his eng ine room 
monitoring screen.  Everything lo oked normal , so he made his way to the bridge.  The chief 
engineer then telephoned the engine control room and asked the (night ) first engineer to 
check the couplings  between the propulsion motors and gearbox , and the propeller shaft  
couplings .   
3.1.7.  The chief  engineer then made his way to the engine  control  room.  As he was doing so the 
master ordered the engines to stop until a further investigation had taken place.  
3.1.8.  By the time the chief engineer arrived in the engine control room the first engineer on duty h ad 
completed checking the couplings .  A low-level alarm had activated for the oil in the starboard 
stern -tube  tank.  
3.1.9.  The chief engineer checked the couplings in the engine room . He then enter ed void-space2 
number eight , where  the coupling between the intermediate shafts and the tail shaft  was 
located .  While  there he asked  that power be applied to the starboard shaft to check if it was 
fully rotati ng.  The shaft  rotated normally , but there was no indication of the propeller 
producing any thrust.   
3.1.10.  Meanwhile , the first mate went down to the stern of the vessel , and as the starboard shaft 
was being tested could see no wash being produced.   
3.1.11.  The master and chief engineer concluded that  either  the starboard propeller had been lost or 
the shaft was not rotat ing it .  The master decided  to continue to Wellington on the port shaft 
and propeller alone , and advised the passengers of the situation.

 Final report MO -2013 -203 3.1.12.  The master and chief engineer then contacted the various maritime authorities and managers 
to advise them of the situation, and of the possibility that the vessel was leaking oil through 
the stern shaft seal .  Tugs and divers were available on the vessel’s arrival  at Wellington . 
3.1.13.  After the Aratere  had berthed in Wellington, a team of divers inspected the underwater area at 
the stern of the vessel .  They d iscovered that the starboard shaft had broken  aft of the stern -
tube seal  and that the starboard propeller was missing  (refer to Figure 4 on page 9 for a 
diagram of the parts of the propeller) . The divers took h igh-resolution photographs of the 
fractured shaft before the shaft end was capped .3   
Recovery of the propeller and shaft stub  
3.1.14.  A specialist company engaged by KiwiRail found the propeller and shaft stub on the seabed on 
23 November  2013 , and recovered them o n 10 December  2013 .  The propeller was 
recovered close to where the Aratere ’s crew had heard the double bang . (See Figure 2.)  
3.1.15.  The propeller was taken to the Commission’s technical  facility  in Wellington .   
Examination of the propeller, the propeller cone and the two surfaces of the fracture  
3.1.16.  The propeller, the propeller cone and the stub of the shaft remaining in the hub of the  
propeller were separated .  Representatives from the Commission, KiwiRail , the propeller 
manufacturer and the classification society  were present .   
3.1.17.  KiwiRail engaged several experts to assist with its own investigation into why the propeller 
shaft had frac tured .  These experts included Quest  (a consultant m etallurgist), Aurecon  (a 
structural i ntegrity consultant) and Stone Marine  (a propeller repair expert).  At KiwiRail’s 
request, Lloyd ’s provided a specialist. The Commission participated in various tests 
undertaken by these experts , which included examination s and measurement s of the 
propeller , propeller cone  and various  samples  from the propeller and tail shaft .  
3.1.18.  Aurecon  produce d a three -dimensional laser surface scan of the propeller.  The scan was used 
to develop a three -dimensional, computer -generated model of the propeller for examination 
and further testing.   
3.1.19.  The stub of the shaft was taken to a metallurgical laboratory , where Quest ’s and Lloyd’s 
experts  exam ined and conducted metal lurgical tests on  it.  The Commission received the 
reports of these examinations and tests.  
3.1.20.  KiwiRail  arranged for the Aratere  to be dry-dock ed in Singapore so it could replace the 
fractured starboard shaft  and, if possible, repair the recovered propeller.  While  the vessel was 
in dry -dock KiwiRail engaged Matcor , which  carried out metallurgical tests and examinations 
of the section of the fractured starboard tail shaft  left protruding from the stern tube of the 
ship.   
3.1.21.  The alignment of both propeller shafts was checked  by DNV  while the ship was in dry -dock .  
 Vessel information   
Description  
3.2.1.  The Aratere  is a passenger and freight ferry owned and operated by KiwiRail .  When the vessel 
was built in Spain in 1998, it was designed to comply with the International C onvention for the 
Safety of Life at Sea 1974 as amended, a convention adop ted by the International Mariti me 
Organiz ation.    
3.2.2.  The Aratere  trades  on a scheduled service between Wellington and Picton with a service 
speed of 19.5 knots .  It was initially certified to ca rry a total o f 399 persons and wa s powered 
                                                        
3 The damaged end of the shaft was capped to prevent oil escaping from the stern -tube seal and water from 
entering the stern -tube. The cap helped to protect a nd preserve the fracture surface for later examination.

 by up  to four diesel -driven , direct -current generators that provide d electrical power as 
required .  This power was supplied via frequency converters to four alternating current electric 
propulsion m otors; two to each shaft.  The two electric motors on each sha ft either singly or 
together dri ve a fixed -pitch propeller through a reduction gearbox.   
Vessel lengthening  
3.2.3.  In 2010 KiwiRail began a project to lengthen the Aratere  to create extra capacity.  In April 
2011 KiwiRail sent the Aratere  to a dry -dock facility in Singapore to have a section 
approximately 30 metres long inserted into the mid -length of the vessel.  Also while in dry -
dock : a new modified bow section was fitted; the stern profile was altered; two extra diesel -
driven, direct -current generators were fitted; and two new, more efficient propellers were 
fitted.

 Analysis : Overview of propeller shaft failures  
 Introduction  
4.1.1.  In this section we explain, in general terms, propellers and propulsion systems . We discuss 
what conditions might cause , or contribute  to, a failure of the type seen in the Aratere ’s 
propeller tail shaft .   
4.1.2.  The various experts’ reports contain valuable evidence and observations . The inquiry drew on 
the reports for its own analysis .  The reports analysed the fatigue crack and shaft failure, and 
the possible causes of the failure.  Several of the investigations  were undertaken immediately 
following the incident whil e others, which were more comprehensive, were undertak en at later 
stages .  
 Propellers and propulsion system s  
Propellers  
4.2.1.  The report refers to  the parts of propellers , which are defined below . Some are illustrated in 
Figure 3 . 
 The hub is the centre of the propeller . Its function is to provide a method of attaching the 
propeller shaft to the blades . 
 The blade root  is where the blade is attached to the hub.  Typically,  this is the thickest 
part of the blade . 
 The blade  is the helical formed section of the propeller that transmits the rotational 
torque of the propeller shaft into thrust to propel the vessel.  Blades are designed with all 
kinds of profile and outline, each offering various benefits in converting torque to thrust . 
The blade acts like an aerofoil, so the shap e and thickness are both critical to the 
performance of the propeller, particularly with respect to cavitation . 
 The blade pressure face  is the high -pressure side of the propeller blade facing away from 
the bow of the vessel , which pushes the water away from the propeller . It is also known as 
the ‘face’ of the propeller . 
 The blade suction face  is the low -pressure side of the propeller blade facing towards the 
bow of the vessel , which sucks the water towards the propeller .  It is also known as the 
‘back ’ of the propeller . 
 The leading edge  runs along the blade outline from the root to the tip , separating the 
pressure and suction face s of the blade.  A sharp leading edge reduces the load on the 
shaft but increases the chance of da mage.  Most leading edge profiles are a trade -off 
between strength and load .   
 The trailing edge  runs along the blade outline from the root to the tip ; it is where the water 
exits the blade.  The profile of the t railing edge is critical in reducing noise a nd harmonics . 
 The blade tip  is formed between the leading and trailing edges on the blade outline.  The 
distance from the centre of the hub to the blade tip multiplied by two describes the 
propeller diameter . 
 The wake  is the flow of water in which the propeller acts to propel the vessel forward.  The 
flow of water is influenced by the shape of the underwater hull of the vessel ahead of the 
propeller.

The parts of the propeller  
4.2.2.  Propeller manufacturers mark propeller s in the vicinity of each blade to differentiate between 
them.  Wärtsilä, the propeller manufacturer, stamped the hubs of the Aratere ’s ‘new’ 
propellers next to the root of each blade A, B, C and D.  This report uses the same lettering to 
describe each bla de.   
What is a propeller shaft ? 
4.2.3.  A propeller shaft usually comprises a tail  shaft and several sections of shaft between the tail 
shaft  and the gearbox called intermediate shafts.  Where the tail shaft  passes through the hull 
of the vessel it is enclosed by  a stern -tube (see Figure 4). On the Aratere  the propeller shaft 
had two main sections made up of (see Figure 4):  
 three intermediate shafts , which had a basic diameter of 275 millimetres (mm) and 
lengths of 4.000 metres, 6.025 metres and 6.000 metres, and  
 the tail shaft , which had a basic diameter of 340 mm, increasing to 352 mm where it 
passed through the aft stern -tube bearing, and was 15. 105 metres long.  
4.2.4.  A propeller shaft transmits power from the gearbox to the propeller located at the stern of the 
vessel outside the hull.  It also transmits the thrust back from the propeller to the thrust 
bearing in the gearbox , which is attached to the v essel , and the thrust is what propels the 
vessel through the water.  
4.2.5.  The total weight of the propeller shaft is supported by bearings; these are usually located on 
pedestals within the engine room, and inside the stern -tube.  The bearings in the stern -tube  
are built in  to the stern -tube and the weight of the stern -tube is supported by the after -end 
arrangements of the vessel’s structure.  The bearings are fixed in place to keep the propeller 
shaft in the correct alignment both vertically and horizontally between the aft stern -tube seal 
and the gearbox or engine.   
4.2.6.  Seals are fitted at either end of the stern -tube to prevent sea  water seeping inside the vessel 
and to stop lubricating oil from the bearings seeping into the sea.

 How are propellers fitted to the propeller shaft?  
4.2.7.  Propellers are (usually) fitted to propeller shafts by means of an ‘interfer ence fit’. In this 
method, the fastening between the propeller and the shaft is achieved by friction after the 
parts are pushed together.  The DNV classification society standards for an interference fit are 
that a minimum of 70% of the propeller bore must  ‘mate’ with the propeller shaft  during the 
’blue fitting ‘ process . 
4.2.8.  To measure the interference fit, the taper on the shaft is coated with a thin blue grease .  The 
propeller is then pushed onto the shaft.  The inside of the propeller bore is examined to 
measure the percentage contact between the shaft and the propeller. If the fit is less than 
70%, the bore of the propeller is hand -scraped to achieve a better fit.  This process is repeated 
until the required standard is achieved. The propeller hub is then e xpanded using hydraulic 
pressure and hydraulically pushed up the tapered tail shaft .  The hydraulic pressure is 
released and the propeller hub shrinks onto the tail shaft , thus achieving the ‘interference fit’.  
 The consequence of a propeller failure  
4.3.1.  Many passenger ferries designed and built for short voyage trades (including the Aratere ) have 
duplicate propulsion systems.   This redundancy is built in to such vessels to mitigate the risks 
inherent in their type of operation — they operate in confined o r congested waters for a high 
proportion of voyages and do frequent manoeuvring in and out of berths.  If one propeller is 
lost from a vessel that has two  of them , it can continue operating  (as illustrated by the 
incident involving the Aratere , which was able to complete its voyage despite losing a 
propeller ). 
4.3.2.  The fracture of a tail shaft  on a modern vessel is, however, unusual.  A high percentage of the 
world’s shipping fleet is fitted with only a single propulsion system.  For example, in 2011 
almost all of the approximately 3,600 large tankers in the world were propelled by single 
propellers.  
4.3.3.  For this reason, lessons from this incident have implications for the world shipping fleet.  
 Causes of propeller shaft failure  
4.4.1.  There are four basic mechanisms that can cause a shaft to fail: corrosion, wear, overload and 
fatigue. The first two, corrosion and wear, very rarely cause shaft failures  in and of themselves , 
and when they do they leave clear evidence.  Of the other two mechanisms, fatigue is more 
common tha n overload failure.  Whilst corrosion and wear are  rarely  the sole cause of shaft 
failure, corrosion and/or wear will often act in conjunction with fatigue loading to cause a 
shaft failure   (Sachs, 2012) .  In this case there was  no evidence of failure due to wear or 
purely overload ; instead the evidence  suggested that shaft failure as a result of fatigue was 
likely.  Accordingly, f atigue cracking  was one of the main areas of interest in the Commission’s 
investigation .   
4.4.2.  A complete  fatigue fracture of a propeller shaft requires two things to have occurred:  
 the formation of a fatigue crack  
 the propagation of the fatigue crack through the propeller shaft , resulting in complete 
failure.  
4.4.3.  To understand what conditions allow  a crack to f orm then propagate , it is useful  first to 
understand fatigue  and the related subject of stress .

 Metal fatigue and stress  
4.5.1.  In engineering,  metal fatigue has been defined as  the (Pook, 2007) : 
gradual degradation and eventual failure that occur under loads which vary with 
time, and which are lower than the  static strength  of the metallic specimen, 
component or structure concerned. The static strength is the load which causes 
failure in one application. The loads responsible are  called  fatigue loads . These 
loads are cyclic in nature, but the cycles are not necessarily all of the same size 
or clearly discernible. A fatigue load in which individual cycles can be 
distinguished is sometimes called a  cyclic load . 
4.5.2.  Fatigue begins when t he surface of the metal deforms because of mechanical damage, 
allowing a crack  to develop .  An example of mechanical damage that can occur on a propeller 
shaft is minute hammering of the tail shaft surface caused by fretting between the propeller 
hub and the propeller shaft.  Surface defects such as manufacturing defects or corrosion pits 
can be a mechanism for the crack initiation.  Cracks work their way into the metal from these 
surface deformations.  As cracks develop, the metal tears.  If undetected, a c rack may 
eventually cause catastrophic failure.  
4.5.3.  A certain level of stress4 is required to cause fatigue.  A rotating propeller shaft is subject to 
several stresses , which  can result from the action of many different forces .  However, not all 
these forces necessarily act simultaneously or on the same areas of the shaft.  In addition,  the 
level of stress resulting in fatigue is lower if any of the following factors alter the surface 
condition of the metal :5 
 stress concentration  
 manufacturing or materials iss ue 
 local stress, including residual stress and contacting stresses  
 fretting  and corrosion . 
Stress concentration  
4.5.4.  Some of the stresses on a propeller shaft are unavoidable due to the method of construction. 
An example is the clamping stress of the propeller  onto the shaft itself, which is a form of 
stress concentration .  In Figure 5 the red represents a higher level of stress concentration 
where the front end of the propeller boss clamps onto the propeller shaft .  Unavoidable 
stresses e xist in most propeller and shaft assemblies, but would normally be well below the 
crack initiation limit.6  A propeller shaft is designed to withstand these foreseen stresses.    
                                                        
4 Stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighbouring particles of a continuous 
material exert on each other.  Stress inside a material may arise by various mechanisms , such as reaction to 
external forces applied to the bulk material (like gravity) or to its surface (like contact forces, external 
pressure , or friction) (Lubliner, 2008)  [as above re definition of differe nt types of stress].

where a propeller is clamped onto a shaft  
Manufacturing or material  issue  
4.5.5.  It is possible that a manufacturing or material issue exists that causes or contributes to a 
fatigue failure. For example, if there is a problem with the milling process of the steel it may 
reduce the expected hardness  of the shaft  and its ability to resist fati gue stresses.  
Local stresses  
4.5.6.  Residual stresses can remain in a structure post manufacturing.  For example, the heating 
and cooling of steel as a result of welding can cause the resulting structure to have residual 
stresses in its resting state.  
Fretting and corrosion  reduce the amount of stress required to cause fatigue  
4.5.7.  Fretting is “a special wear process that occurs at the contact area between two materials 
under load and subject to minute relative motion by vibration or some other force ” (ASM 
International, 1996) . Fretting can occur as a result of a poor fit between the propeller hub and 
the propeller shaft , resulting in unexpected movement and degradation of the contacting 
surfaces.  “Fretting  decreases the fatigue strength of materials operating under cyclic stress. 
The reduced fatigue strength can result in fatigue cracks initiating in the fretting zone ” 
(Lipsom & Colwell, 1961) .  Afterwards, the crack can propagate into the shaft if sufficient 
forces exist to allow this.  
4.5.8.  Most  metals are vulnerable to corrosion and this is especially  so when metals are potentially 
in contact with salt water. Like fretting, corrosion alters the surface of metals , making them 
more susceptible to fatigue  cracking . 
4.5.9.  Alone or in combination, fretting and corrosion  can reduce the fatigue limit to as low as one -
tenth that in dry air, and therefore make a propeller shaft more vulnerable to fatigue.7

 Vibration  
4.6.1.  If fretting or some other cause has initiated a fatigue crack in a propeller shaft, bending in the 
shaft can result in the crack growing.  Vibration is one of several bending stressors that can 
emanate from different parts of the propulsion system and for different reasons.  External 
sources can also induce vibration in the propulsion system.   
4.6.2.  Vibration can be lateral or torsional.   Lateral vibration is movement orthogonal to (that is, at 
right angles to) the shaft’s axis.  Torsional vibration is twisting about the shaft’s longitudinal 
axis.  Measurement s of both are used to identify potential problems  within the propulsion 
plant and determine the fatigue life of an individual part or assembly  within the propulsion 
system .  The two types of vibration can be analysed separately or together .  Frequently one 
causes the other .  For example, lateral vibration in the tail of an aircraft produces torsional 
vibration in the fuselage, and the firing of pistons in a large marine engine can cause twisting 
forces in the propeller shaft.  
4.6.3.  All systems, including propulsion systems, have a natural level of vibration. Resonance occurs 
when the natural vibration is multiplied by vibration from another source that is at the same 
frequency as the natural vibration of the system.   
Alignment of the  propeller shaft  
4.6.4.  If the entire propeller shaft is incorrectly aligned, the load on the motors  increases  and the 
bearings are subjected to increased  stress es.  The abnormal stress can result in bearing 
damage , including breakage and increased vibration.  
 Cavitation  
4.7.1.  Cavitation occurs when bubbles generated by propellers collapse (implode) and create an 
intense shock wave, which are strong enough to cause damage to moving parts.  Repeated 
implosions near a metal surface cause cyclic stress.  More specificall y, cavitation occurs  
(Kinnas & Young, 2003) : 
when pressure drops below the saturated vapour  pressure of the liquid, 
consequently resulting in the formation of gas filled or gas and vapour  filled 
bubbles. A type of  cavitation  that is common on marine propellers is sheet  
cavitation . It is characterized by a “continuous ” liquid/ vapour  interface which is 
“attached ” to the blade surface. Despite its undesirable nature, some sheet (or 
other types of)  cavitation  often has to be accepted in order to maintain efficiency. 
Thus, accurate prediction of  cavitation  is very crucial in the design and analysis 
of marine propellers.

 Analysis: The f racture in the  Aratere ’s propeller shaft  
 What type of fracture occurred on  the Aratere ? 
5.1.1.  Various experts8 concluded that the type of fracture that occurred on the Aratere ’s starboard 
propeller shaft was a fatigue fracture, typical of that resulting from uni axial  bending forces  
acting on a rotating shaft .  Shaft failures resulting from bending fatigue display a unique 
fracture surface not seen in other types of shaft fatigue failure.  Figure 6 is a drawing of a 
typical plane bending fatigue failure in  a rotating shaft.  The drawing shows how a crack start s 
at the origin and slowly propagates (grows) across the fatigue zone. When the crack reaches 
the boundary of the instantaneous zone, its growth rate increases significantly . (Sachs, 2012)  
5.1.2.  The drawing in Figure 6 shows remarkable similarities to the photograph of the shaft fracture 
face of the Aratere ’s propeller shaft, shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7  
Underwater photograph of the shaft fracture face  in the Aratere  
5.1.3.  The Commission determined  that the fracture was a fatigue fracture typical of that resulting 
from bending forces being applied. Figure 7 demonstrates  that the fracture seen on the 
Aratere ’s starboard propeller shaft had all the hallmarks of a bending fatigue failu re, with 
readily identifiable fracture origin  and progression/arrest marks, and an 
instantaneous/overload fracture zone.  
5.1.4.  Quest described the fatigue crack in the starboard propeller shaft of the Aratere  as being 
multi -origined , indicating that the surface  cyclic loading on the shaft was well above the 
fatigu e limit for the material.  The amount of  stress required  to cause a fatigue failure  varies  
depending on the level of average stress present.  Quest further concluded that as  the crack 
propagated, the st ress concentration increased and the crack grew faster.  It was probable 
that towards the end of the fracture the major arrest marks relate d to significant changes in 
the operation of the vessel.  These could have been  individual sailings or specific loadings 
where high stress was applied.9 
5.1.5.  Other evidence also supports fatigue fractur e as a result of bending forces.  
 The f racture plane was (aside from the area of final overload) at 90 degrees to the 
longitudinal axis of the propeller  and had a relativel y smooth face .10 
 Progression (b each ) marks were present , which was indicative of fatigue crack 
propagation .11 
 The o rientation of the crack suggest ed the involvement of bending and possible axial 
stresses .12

  The presence of other fatigue cracks in the vicinit y of the fracture, including an additional 
fatigue crack that was diametrically opposite the initiation point of the fracture, was 
indicative of reverse bending forces.13 
Findings  
1. The fracture was determined to be a fati gue fracture resulting from uniaxial  
bending forces.  
2. There had to be a source or sources present that produced bending forces 
capable of propagating the fatigue crack through the tail shaft.  
 
 What factors might have contributed to the fracture ? 
5.2.1.  Cracks in rotating shafts leave evidence of e xisting conditions that allowed the crack s to form. 
The factors that con tributed to the shaft failure fe ll into two categories:  
 factors that could have weakened the shaft by altering its metal surface condition, such 
as manufacturing or material faults, local stresses, and fretting and corrosion  
 factors sufficient to cause fatigue cracking to start at the weakened metal surface , such 
as vibration  and bending, from any source . 
5.2.2.  If bending is sufficient to cause fatigue failure of the propeller shaft, the fracture would occur 
at the point of highest bending load  on the shaft. That point is at the edge of the last bearing 
at the end of the stern -tube.  On the Aratere , however, the fracture occurred approximately 14  
mm inside the tapered fit of the propeller hub , the fracture began at a point between the roots 
of blades C and D, which corresponded  with the trailing edge of blade C. In other words, the 
failure of the propeller shaft i nside the hub could not have been the result of bending forces 
alone.  Some other factors must have been present to cause the fatigue fracture to occur  (see 
Figure 8) .

 Analysis: Weakening of the tail shaft  and i nitiation  of the crack  
 Introduction  
6.1.1.  In this part of the analysis we discuss what factors might have contributed to the weakening of 
the Aratere ’s tail shaft  and led to the initiation of a crack.  
 Was there a manufacturing fault  in the tail shaft ? 
6.2.1.  Advice from Quest , and data provided by Wärtsilä , indicate d that a tail shaft  manufacturing 
defect did not contribute to the failure.   
6.2.2.  Quest  considered the strength of the shaft to be in accordance with the reported strength in 
the mill certificate.  Quest  measured the ‘hardness’ of the shaft and the results showed a 
hardness equating to a tensile strength of 640 -840 megapascals (MPa) .14  The steel mill that 
manufactured the shaft produced a mill certificate  indicating an allowable range of 600 -650 
MPa.  The mill certificate for the shaft recorded test results for the shaft of between 650 and 
682 MPa.   
6.2.3.  Quest ’s conclusion, supported by the fact that the propeller shafts had been operating 
successful ly for some 13 years before being fitted with new propellers,  ruled out the possibility 
of a tail shaft  manufacturing defect contributing to the failure.   
6.2.4.  A propeller shaft is designed to withstand variable stresses. These foreseen stresses include 
those that occur at the nodes where the end of the propeller hub is clamped to the shaft.  
Wärtsilä (the propeller designer) provided data that the stresses at the nodes were expected 
to be double those in the surrounding area. Testing15 following the incident calculated the 
stresses to be as expected . This further support ed the conclusion that there was no 
manufacturing fault in the tail shaft.  
 Did f retting  and/or corrosion  contribute to weakening of the propeller shaft?  
Evidence of fretting  on the starboard tail shaft  
6.3.1.  The Aurecon ‘Final Report ’ commissioned by KiwiRail concluded that there was no evidence of 
fretting damage in the origin area of the fatigue crack, and that fretting was unlikely to have 
been  the primary root cause of the failure.16  However, t here was evidence of fretting  on the 
starboard tail shaft  around the point of origin of the fatigue crack . Figure 8 shows  areas of 
fretting around the circumference of the shaft  next to the fracture zone.  Quest  considered :17 
This indicates that one or more of the factors to reduce the fatigue limit were 
significant. No significant [more than 5 %] corrosion or surface defects were 
observed on the shaft prior to the failure. However, a significant amount of fretting 
was present. It i s probable that this was a major factor in reducing the fatigue limit. 
However, where the fretting had occurred between the bronze and steel, the majority 
of physical damage has occurred to the softer bronze material  [of the propeller] . This 
was seen as fr etting pitting, fretting debris and bonding of the b ronze material onto 
the shaft. However, in the steel shaft, even though there was only minor physical 
evidence of fretting damage, it will have seen a significant surface hammering 
loading which will have  modified the local surface loading. Some evidence was 
present that this loading was in excess of the yield stress in the material and 
localised deformation occurred.  
                                                        
14 The ‘hardness ’ test was conducted using the Vickers Pyramid Number (HV) . The result was 200-250 HV, 
which equates to a tensile strength of 640 -840 MPa.  
15 The engineering firm conducting the tests used a finite element analysis, which is a computational tool 
that includes the use of mesh generation techniques for dividing a complex problem into small elements, as 
well as the use of a software program coded with FEM algorithm.

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report MO -2013 -203 6.3.2.  A subsequent report carried out by Quest concluded:  
 that the most severe fretting damage was adjacent to blade C18 
 the presence of significant corrosion pitting19  
 that a significant amount of fretting was present and it was probably a major factor in 
reducing the fatigue limit.20 
6.3.3.  The Commission ’s view , based on its analysis , is that fretting  likely  reduce d the amount of 
stress required to initiate fatigue failure. The movement of the shaft due to the formation of 
the fracture would have  also caused a  certain amount of the fretting ; that is, as the fracture 
propagated through the shaft, movemen t between the fracture surfaces increased the  fretting 
between the shaft and the propeller hub. 
6.3.4.  This view is also supported by the peer review undertaken by AMC  Search , which concluded 
that “on the basis of the evidence it appears safe to conclude that fre tting damage occurred 
and is likely to have caused a stress riser that ultimately led to fatigue ”.21  
6.3.5.  In addition to the Quest findings in respect of corrosion, Lloyd’s found evidence of corrosion on 
the starboard propeller shaft around its circumference wi thin 100  mm of the top/forward end 
of the taper. Lloyd’s determined  that the most likely cause of the corrosion was historical sea 
water contamination of the stern -tube lubricating oil.22    
Comparison with fretting  and corrosion in the port tail shaft  
6.3.6.  Evidence of fretting and evidence of corrosion were  apparent on the port tail  shaft  as well as 
the starboard tail shaft .  When the Aratere  was dry -docked in 2014, KiwiRail engaged Matcor  
to assist in its investigation of the incident. Matcor  is an expert in the field of materials and 
corrosion .  Matcor’s  report on the condition of the port shaft  included the following :23 
The surface of the shaft at the propeller seat hub area was generally satisfactory 
apart from the scattered presence of irregular blackish patches and copperish 
tint particularly near the forward end of the hub. Localized corrosion in the form 
of clusters of minute pits of up to about 1.0mm deep was observed within the 
irregular blackish areas. The copperish tint observed at scattered areas o f the 
shaft was essentially associated with the aluminium  bronze material of the 
propeller hub that had smeared onto the shaft surface. The microstructure and 
hardness condition of the shaft was generally satisfactory and consistent with the 
material speci fication requirements.  
6.3.7.  Both the port and starboard propeller shafts were corroding to some degree and there had 
been fretting between both propeller  hubs and their respective propeller shafts, yet only the 
starboard propeller shaft failed. This means  that either the starboard propeller shaft had been 
weakened more than the port shaft, or the starboard shaft was prone to more severe vibration 
than the port shaft, or a combination of the two.

 Analysis: Fitting  of the new propellers  
 Introduction  
7.1.1.  In the prev ious section we  presented evidence of  fretting between the propeller tail shaft s and 
the hubs of the propeller s. As explained in paragraph 4.5.2 , fretting between the propeller tail 
shaft s and the hubs of the propellers causes minu te hammering of the tail shaft  surface. This 
hammering can ca use mechanical damage on the metal surfaces , causing them to deform 
and allowing a crack to initiate.  
7.1.2.  The fretting indicate d that the fit between the shafts and the hubs was not optimum. It was 
therefore necessary to review the fitment of the new propellers in 2011, and whether the fit 
achieved had been  satisfactory.  This fitting of the propellers is discussed further in this 
section.   
 Replacement of the propellers  
7.2.1.  The fitting of the new propelle rs to the Aratere  was part of the project to lengthen the vessel.  
KiwiRail instructed the shipyard undertaking the lengthening to  also fit the new propellers.  
Replacement of propellers is a significant undertaking , and Wärtsilä advised KiwiRail that the 
preferred  method for fitting the new propellers was to  remove the propeller shafts and fit the 
propellers vertically. An alternative and less desirable method for fitting the propellers is 
horizontally , which does not require  the removal of the propeller s hafts. It is a  less desirable 
method because it is technically more difficult and entails  a higher risk of damage to the 
propeller hub or shaft.  
7.2.2.  Notwithstanding Wärtsilä’s recommendation, KiwiRail opted for the latter method , which 
meant the propeller shaf ts did not need to be removed.   
DNV rules for fitting propellers  
7.2.3.  When new propellers were fitted to the Aratere  in 2011, they should have met standards set 
by the classification society, DNV.  
7.2.4.  A classification society sets technical standards for the construction and operation of ships.  
The International Association of Classification Societies describes the aim of ship 
classification being to  (IACS, 2016) : 
verify the structural strength and integrity of essential parts of the ship’s hull and 
its appendages, and the reliability and function of the propulsion and steering 
systems, power generation and those other features and auxiliary systems which 
have been built into the ship in order to maintain essential services on boar d. 
Classification Societies aim to achieve this objective through the development 
and application of their own Rules and by verifying compliance with international 
and/or national statutory regulations on behalf of flag Administrations.  
7.2.5.  A classification so ciety may issue a certificate of classification for a vessel designed and built 
to its rules. The certificate does not imply a warrant of safety, fitness for purpose or 
seaworthiness, because the classification society has no control over how the ship is o perated 
or maintained.  
7.2.6.  The DNV standard for fitting  propellers is that at least 70% of the propeller bore must ‘mate’  
with the propeller shaft, which is determined through the blue -fitting process.  The DNV 
classification society rules state ( DNV, 2013 ): 
Prior to final pull -up, the contact area between the mating surfaces shall be not less 
than 70% of the theoretical contact area (100%).  Non -contact bands (except oil 
grooves) extending circumferentially around the hub or over the full length of the hub 
are not acceptable.  At the big end there shall be a full contact band of at least 20% 
of the taper length.   
 

<< Page 22 >>
 Final report MO -2013 -203 7.2.7.  DNV had changed the rules in 2006 to clarify the final requirement; that is, that at the big end 
there was to be a full contact band of at least 20%.   
7.2.8.  In addition to shipyard and KiwiRail staff, KiwiRail requested a representative of DNV to 
observe the replacement of the propellers. As part of its investigations t he Commission sought  
information relating to the fitting of the new  propeller s.  None of KiwiRail,  DNV or the shipyard  
was able to provide any reports or notes from the propeller -fitting process.   
7.2.9.  KiwiRail’s e ngagement of DNV to be present at the fitting suggests  that KiwiRail expect ed the 
DNV representative to check or inspect  the fit . A job sheet provided to the Commission  state d 
that the DNV representative was performing an ‘inspection ’, which suggests  that that person  
was more than an observer.  
7.2.10.  In its submission on the draft report, KiwiRail stated that it had engaged the DNV surveyor to 
witness and sign off that the fitting of the propeller was done in accordance with DNV rules .  
KiwiRail stated that it was not appropriate for it to specify what DNV should do or look at while 
present , and therefore KiwiRail did not expect to have to do so .  However, i n the Commission’s 
view, as KiwiRail undertook to complete the fitting of the starboard propeller onto the shaft 
using its own expert and labour , the responsibility for ensuring that this task was completed 
satisfactorily rested with KiwiRail.   Therefore, it would have been good practice for KiwiRail to 
have ensured by seeking a report or confirmation from the DNV representative that the fitting 
process was in accordance with the DNV Rules .  
The quality of the fit achieved  
7.2.11.  According to KiwiRail  staff, the initial fit of the ‘new’ propellers onto the shaft taper achieved 
only 40%  contact with the mating surfaces .  Reportedly the majority of the ‘fit’ was at the 
narrower end of the taper (whereas the DNV rule required the better fit to be at the w ider end 
of the taper). Several attempts were made to achieve an adequate fit.  The repeated attempts 
would have increased the opportunity for damage to occur to the  contact  surfaces . 
7.2.12.  None of KiwiRail, the  shipyard  or DNV could provide the Commission with any records to show 
whether the relevant  DNV standards were met regarding the level of ‘fit’ achieved between the 
propeller bore and the tail shaft .24  Any fitting achieving less than 100% contact risked fretting 
from microscopic movements between the tail shaft  and the propeller bore, which could have 
weakened the metal surface and made it more susceptible to fatigue cracking. The 
distribution of the contact area would have affected how much movement could occur under 
operational loading.  In addition, it is not known whether the repeated fitting attempts caused 
any damage to the tail shaft  or propeller hub.  
7.2.13.  The Commission notes that the DNV rules required a full contact area of at least 20% of the 
taper length at the big end of the hub. This is the area where fretting was observed around the 
Aratere ’s fractured tail shaft  (see Figure 9 on page 23).  
Longitudinal fit  
7.2.14.  When the propeller wa s fitted onto the tail shaft  in dry -dock it should have pushed right up to 
the end of the taper, where the propeller hub would mate with a mechanical seal on the end 
of the stern -tube .  However, it fell about 8  mm short.  Instead of adjusting the bore of the 
propeller hub, the propeller was withdrawn and an 8  mm spacer was inserted to achieve the 
required mating between the propeller hub and the mechanical seal  (see Figure 9).   
                                                        
24 DNV was able to supply four photographs of the pro peller blueing process, but th e photographs were not 
annotated as to which propeller they depicted  or at what stage of the blueing they had been  taken.  
 
Final report MO -2013 -203 
<< Page 23 >>
  
Figure 9 
Location of the 8 mm spacer  
7.2.15.  It is not clear whether th e 8 mm spacer was required as a result of an overall error in the size 
of the taper in the propeller hub, or because of  high spots and imperfections in the bore 
created during the propeller manufacturing process .  Given that only a 40% interference fit 
was achieved on the first attempt to mate the propeller hub with the tail shaft , the latter was 
more likely to have been  the case.  If this was the case, a substantial amount of ‘linishing ’25 
would have been require d to achieve the minimum 70% interference fit.   Interviews with 
KiwiRail  staff who were assisting with the fitting procedure revealed that this process of 
blueing, fitting, removing and linishing of the propeller bore was repeated several times in an 
attem pt to get the required interference fit.  
Crack testing on the tail shaft s  
7.2.16.  KiwiRail did not provide the Commission with  any record s of whether crack tests on the tail 
shaft s had been specified or performed before the fitting of the new propellers.   Best  
engineering  practice would have been for  KiwiRail to undertak e crack testing  of the  tail shaft s 
to ensure  that no cracks were present before the fitting of the new propellers .   
7.2.17.  Some evidence suggests that a test was performed.26 Further,  experts engaged b y KiwiRail 
consider ed that  the fatigue cracks occurred after the new propellers were fitted , given that 
there were no signs of wear on the old starboard propeller that correspond ed with the wear on 
the tail shaft.  
7.2.18.  Because the Commission was unable to obtain documentation confirming whether crack 
testing had been  carried out when the new propellers were fitted , it cannot be certain about

26 An email betw een KiwiRail  and the propeller manufacturer  on 15/02/2011  noted that crack testing had

Lack of records and formal oversight  of the propeller fitting process  
7.2.19.  In the Commission’s view it is significant that KiwiRail, and to a lesser extent DNV or the 
shipyard, could not provide any records from the propeller -fitting process  to the Comm ission . It 
suggests that KiwiRail had no way of knowing whether the propellers had been fitted correctly 
and whether the relevant rules had been met.   
7.2.20.  The r eplacement of propellers on a vessel the size of the Aratere  is a significant undertaking 
and it would be normal for formal record s of the process to be available . There is no evidence 
of KiwiRail following  up with DNV about its representative’s inspection or observations  of the 
fitting process , or whether KiwiRail sought a report of that person’s inspection .  
Finding s  
3. Based on the physical evidence, the reason for the fretting was likely to have 
been the  quality of the fit achieved between the tapered propeller tail shaft  
and the propeller hub when the new propeller was fitted during the extension  
project.  
4. Fretting between the starboard propeller hub and the tail shaft  and corrosion 
on the metal surface of the tail shaft  would have  likely decreased its fatigue 
strength . 
5. It is likely  that the fatigue crack occurred after the new propellers were fitt ed 
as there were no signs of wear on the old starboard propeller .  
6. It is unclear what DNV’s role or responsibilit y was in respect of the fitting 
process and whether that responsibilit y was  met, as there were no formal 
records made. This also meant  that it was not possible to determine the quality 
of the fitting process.

 Analysis: Crack propagation  from vibration  
 Introduction  
8.1.1.  In section 5 we presented evidence showing that it was a fatigue fracture that occurred on the 
Aratere ’s starboard propeller . As the fatigue fracture propagated as a result of uniaxial 
bending, it is necessary to determine what sources of uniaxial bending existed.  The main 
source s of uniaxial bending  are vibration  and abnormal uneven thrust between individual 
blades of the propeller . 
8.1.2.  External sources of vibration can induce vibration in a propulsion system , but this was unlikely 
for the Aratere  because no vibration from external sources was noted on the vessel befo re the 
incident. Therefore,  this section examines potential sources of vibration from within the 
Aratere ’s propulsion system to determine if vibration  was a factor .  
 Did r esonance  contribute to the tail shaft  failure?  
8.2.1.  In physics , elasticity is the ability  of a body to resist a distorting influence and return to its 
original shape when the distorting influence (stress) is removed.  In this case the Aratere ’s 
propeller shaft and propeller was an elastic body . As explained by Bhatt (2010):  
any elastic body ca n vibrate freely.  Its vibrations are called natural vibrations.  
Frequency of these vibrations is called natural frequency.  Each vibrating body has 
its natural frequency . (Bhatt, 2010)  
8.2.2.  Resonance is when a vibrating system or external force drives another system to oscillate with 
a greater amplitude at a specific frequency.  The resonant frequency is approximately equal to 
the natural frequency.   
8.2.3.  For the Aratere ’s propeller shaft and propeller , there is a  critical speed of rot ation  or blade 
pass frequency that excites the natural frequency of the propeller shaft or propeller.  As th is 
speed of rotation approaches the propeller shaft and propeller’s  natural frequency , the 
propeller shaft and propeller  begins to resonate , which d ramatically increases the propeller 
shaft and propeller’s vibration .  
8.2.4.  Following the incident , Wärtsilä and Lloyd’s produced calculations that indicated resonance 
was unlikely to have contributed to the tail shaft  failure.  These calculation s are discussed 
next. 
Lloyd’s calculations  of vibration  
8.2.5.  Lloyd’s carried out calculations of the natural frequencies of shaft -line lateral vibration for the 
Aratere  in December 2013, after the incident. It found that  the frequency of natural vibration 
of the shaft (where it would vibrate freely without any extra external force applied) was within 
the normal operating revolutions of the propeller and shaft.  Thus any forced vibration induced 
into the system at the frequency of natural vibration, for whatever reason, would h ave caused 
a manifold increase in the amplitude of the natural vibration  (resonance ).   
Wärtsilä’s calculation  of vibration  
8.2.6.  In 2010  Wärtsilä designed a modification to the propeller cones (refer to the section on 
propeller weight and balance below). At the  time Wärtsilä recommended to KiwiRail that it  
calculate torsion and vibration.  In correspondence with Wärtsilä KiwiRail advised  that it had 
asked a shafting expert to carry out the torsional and vibration calculations.  KiwiRail was 
unable to produce the  calculations, so it is unknown whether the y were ever completed.   
8.2.7.  Following the incident Wärtsilä completed torsional and vibration calculations. The 
calculations showed torsion and vibration were within acceptable limits, and therefore unlikely 
to have contributed to the tail shaft  failure.  
 

<< Page 26 >>
 Final report MO -2013 -203 8.2.8.  Cyclic stress would have ele vated lateral vibration in the part of the shaft between the face of 
the propeller hub facing forwards and the aft stern -tube bearing, in close proximity to where 
the fracture did occur.  If lateral vibration had been present,  it would have manifested in t he 
place the crack initiated. Lloyd’s report indicate d that lateral vibration could not be excluded 
as a possible  contributing factor to the formation of the fracture in the shaft.   
8.2.9.  Lloyd’s report stated28: 
It is likely that the shaft -line first natural fr equency of lateral vibration has been 
within the range of blade rate29 excitation generated during normal vessel 
operations.  The  history of problems with the port and starboard aft stern seals and 
associated water contamination of the stern -tube lubricatin g oil are also generally 
symptomatic of lateral vibration.  
Resonance at the first natural frequency of lateral vibration would result in elevated 
levels of cyclic bending stress in the shaft forward of the propeller and in way of the 
‘A’-bracket bearing.  Vibratory amplitudes would be controlled by damping around 
the propeller and oil film damping in the ‘A’ -bracket and auxiliary bearings.  
8.2.10.  Therefore, it is possible that lateral vibration contributed to the failure of the Aratere ’s 
starboard propeller shaft.  Although lateral vibration would have made only a minor 
contribution to the failure, it would nevertheless have added to an y accumulation of other 
factors.  
Finding  
7. Tail shaft  lateral vibration and/or torsional vibration was unlikely to have been 
a major contributor to the fatigue cracking.  However, if it were present it would 
have affected the area of the tail shaft  where the fracture occurred.  
 
 Did mis alignment  of the propeller shaft contribute to the shaft failure?  
The consequences of a misaligned shaft  
8.3.1.  A misaligned propeller shaft increases vibration above that for a well  aligned shaft. Increased 
vibration is likely to contribute to the bending forces that, if sufficient, initiate and propagate a 
fatigue crack.  
8.3.2.  Misalign ment also increases the load on the propulsion motors and generators, because more 
power is required to rotate the shaft.  There would also be an increased load on the bearings, 
which could lead to premature wear and possible breakage.   
History of the ali gnment of the Aratere ’s propeller shafts  
8.3.3.  Since being built in 1998 the Aratere  had had several problems with the alignment of both its 
port and starboard propeller shafts, resulting in realignments on three occasions between 
2003 and 2013. These issues are  described in more detail in Appendix 1 ; however , the 
Commission notes that the aft stern -tube bearing had fatigue -type damage, and the starboard 
aft stern -tube bearing had a large piece broken off that was likely to be from fatigue.30  
8.3.4.  When the Aratere  was in dry -dock in Singapore in 2011 to lengthen the vessel, a KiwiRail 
contractor advise d on, and deal t with, aligning and fitting the propeller shafts and new 
propellers.

 8.3.5.  The contractor took measurements before and after the hull was  extended , which showe d 
there was a 25 mm shift to port and 10 mm downward roll of  the hull .  The contractor also  
supervised the realign ment of the port and starboard shafts once the vessel was afloat.  It did 
this while the tail shaft s were in place (that is, it did not remove them from the hull, which 
would have been the preferred practice  because it would have allowed the propeller  shafts  to 
be aligned along their whole length ).  
Post-incident measurements of the alignment of both propeller shafts  
8.3.6.  In 2014, after the incident, KiwiRail sent the Aratere  to dry -dock to replace the broken tail 
shaft  and refit the old propellers.  KiwiRail also took the opportunity to ensure that the 
alignment of the propeller shaft and gearbox was correct.  Both propell er shafts were 
misaligned, with the starboard shaft showing a greater degree of misalignment than the port 
shaft. The starboard shaft would therefore have been  likely to  have more vibration than the 
port shaft.   
8.3.7.  Measurements of the starboard propeller sha ft alignment showed that the section of propeller 
shaft between the gearbox and the stern -tube was well aligned  and the section of tail shaft  
between the propeller and the stern -tube bush was also well aligned .  However, these two 
separate sections were no t well aligned with each other .  In other words, there was an error in 
the overall alignment of the propeller shaft between the gearbox and the propeller.  
8.3.8.  Overall, the shaft was out of alignment with the gearbox by approximately 27 mm vertically 
and 8 mm h orizontally (see Appendix 4 for full details).  The misalignment was most 
pronounced between the section of the propeller shaft forward of the stern -tube bush and the 
tail shaft  aft of the stern -tube bush.  The misalignment was most likely a consequence of  
attempting to align the entire propeller shaft without withdrawing the tail shaft s.  
8.3.9.  Measurements of the port tail shaft  alignment showed that the shaft was  also out of 
alignment with the gearbox by approximately 23 mm vertically and 6 mm horizontally (see 
Appendix 4 for full details).   
8.3.10.  The misalignments on both propeller shafts would have:  
 increased the load on the propulsion motors and generators, because more  power was 
required to rotate the shaft s 
 increased load on the bearings  (damage was found on both  aft-stern tube bearings)  
 increased vibration.    
8.3.11.  Three events suggest there was increased vibration in the shafting :  
 an increase in accelerations within the s tarboard gearbox , which occurred some  time 
after March 2012 . A KiwiRail t echnician on the Aratere  detected the increase during the 
vibration readings that they took  quarterly . Until this  point  the technician had not 
detected any increase in vibrations sinc e the Aratere  had been lengthened in 2011  
 the failure of one coupling between the starboard gearbox and one propulsion motor  
 a tear appearing in the coupling between the same (starboard) gearbox and the other 
propulsion motor .

arrangement.

8. The propeller shafts on the Aratere  had a history of misalignment and 
associated failures that could  be expected to result from such misalignment.  
9. Neither the port nor the starboard propeller shaft s were well aligned when the 
new propellers were fitted during the extension project . The misalignment of 
the starboard shaft was worse than that of the port shaft.  This misalignment  
would have  likely  contributed to vibration with in the tail shaft  area, although 
this factor alone should not necessarily have caused the tail shaft  to fracture . 
 
 Did the weight and balance  of the propeller cause uni axial bending forces ? 
Weight  
8.4.1.  The new propellers fitted to the Aratere  in 2011 during the extension project were lighter  than 
the old ones  (see Table 2) . The propeller cone was modified to accommodate this change, and 
became heavier as a result. The Commission was  unable to determine whether the greater 
weight of the propell er cone contributed to increased vibration in the pro peller shaft because 
KiwiRail did  not carry out torsional or vibration calculations.

8.4.2.  In December 2010 , during the planning phase for the extension project,  Wärtsilä advised  
KiwiRail  that, because of the de creased weight of the new propellers,  the aft  stern -tube 
bearing would have to  be modified . Wärtsilä  advised that the modification would ensure that 
the load on the bearing remained the same as with the original propellers , but the procedure 
required the tail shaft s to be removed .   
8.4.3.  KiwiRail  decided  not to remove the tail shaft s and did not inclu de their removal  in the dry-dock  
specification .  KiwiRail  requested that Wärtsilä find another way to ensure  that the same 
loading on the bearing  was achieved .   
8.4.4.  Wärtsilä offered two options.  T he first was to redesign the ‘new’ propeller to be the same 
weight as the ‘old’ propeller .  However, the efficiency gain would have been  about 0.8% less 
than Wärtsilä’s original design , and this option would have incur red a time delay and possible 
additional design costs.  The second option , which KiwiRail took,  was to increase the size and 
weight of the propeller cone to give the same bearing load as before.   
8.4.5.  Wärtsilä designed a modification to the propeller cone, increasin g the weight of the cone from 
the original 120 kilograms (kg) to 1 ,020 kg.  This resulted in the same bearing load as the 
original propeller and cone.  However, due to the increased weight  of the propeller cone 
Wärtsilä advised KiwiRail  to complete a new t orsional and vibration calculation. Wärtsilä had 
not included such a calculation in its original cost estimate.  KiwiRail  made no  request  to 
Wärtsilä  (or any other expert) to undertake a torsional and vibration calculation .

 Balance  
8.4.6.  If the propeller cone wa s either unbalanced or fitted at an angle to the face of the propeller 
hub, such that the centre of mass was not align ed with  the shaft and propeller, this would 
have caused increased vibration.  This could have been a minor contributing factor to the 
overall vibration in the propeller shaft. However, the Commission  could not determine whether  
the propeller cone was unbalanced or fitted at an angle.  
8.4.7.  The question of whether the propeller cone was balanced or not arose because of the 
discovery of a rubber gasket inserted in the joint between the cone and the hub. The propeller 
cone  was designed to mate with the back  of the propeller  hub and was designed  with a n ‘O’ 
ring seal. The inclusion of the rubber gasket  in the joint would have made tensioning the stud 
bolts to the correct torque more susceptible to error because of  the compression of the rubber 
seal.  Had one part of the seal been more compressed than the rest , the cone  may have been 
at a slight  angle to the hub, possibly inducing vibration.   
Finding s 
10. The method of fitting the cone to the starboard propeller  was not in accordance 
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The Commission could not determine  
whether the cone was in line with the tail shaft  and propeller . If it was not  in 
line, it would likely have caused minor vibration to the tail shaft  in the region 
where it cracked . This factor alone would  not have caused the tail shaft  to 
fractur e.

 Analysis: Stress loading on the tail shaft from the propeller    
 Introduction  
9.1.1.  The fatigue crack in the starboard tail shaft developed just within the leading edge of the 
propeller hub.  As mentioned previously , a certain amount of stress is required for a fatigue 
crack to form and propagate through the tail shaft.  Consequently, the performance of the 
starboard propeller was a significant focus for the Commission.   
9.1.2.  The fatigue crack’s origin was between the roo ts of blades C and D in line with the trailing 
edge of blade C.31 
9.1.3.  Typical stressors that initiate and drive the type of fatigue crack seen in the Aratere ’s tail shaft 
are those that cause uniaxial bending of the tail shaft.  Uniaxial bending can be caused by 
uneven thrust between the individual propeller blades.  All blades on a propeller will produce 
uneven thrust as they rotate through the wake field comin g off the stern of the ship.  The 
amount of uneven thrust can vary if there is an appreciable difference between the average 
pitch of each blade.  It can also vary if cavitation causes each blade to operate at a different 
efficiency.  
9.1.4.  Cavitation is when cav ities (bubbles) of vapour form in a liquid at low pressure; when the 
pressure increases the bubbles implode.  These implosions can cause intense shock waves 
that are capable of causing cyclic stress and surface fatigue if near to a metal surface. A 
distinc t erosion  or ‘orange peel ’ effect on metal surfaces will often be visible, and this was 
observed on the Aratere ’s starboard propeller (see Figure 10). Where cavitation occurs over a 
large area, a significant load can occur and can int roduce a flutter -type vibration to the 
blade.32 
9.1.5.  When designing ships, naval architects anticipate forces from uneven thrust and cavitation, 
and tail shafts should be able to withstand these forces.  However, if a tail shaft is in a 
weakened state through fr etting or corrosion, as was the case for the Aratere , such forces can 
initiate and propagate a fatigue crack.   
9.1.6.  Consequently, variation s in the average pitch between individual propeller blades and the 
effects of cavitation are considered in the following sections.  
 Uniaxial bending as a result of variation in propeller blade pitch  
9.2.1.  The blades on the ‘new’ starboard propeller as manufactured had deviated from the design 
pitch (as illustrated in Appendix 3). Although the differences were within the relevant IS O 
(International Organization for Standardization) standard tolerances, it is likely  that this 
variance in pitch produced uneven thrust and cavitation from the time the propeller was fitted.  
9.2.2.  Following the recovery of the starboard propeller, multiple exper ts examined it and Aurecon 
laser -scanned and measured it. The propeller had sustained damage that had altered the 
pitch of all four of its blades and the pitch varied from the as -built pitch (see Appendix 3).  The 
extent  of variation was different for each  blade : blade A had the largest difference between 
the manufactured and post -incident pitch; blade B had less difference in pitch; blade C had 
less again; and blade D had the least difference in pitch.  
9.2.3.  DNV, as the vessel’s classification society, surveyed  the Aratere  annually and had noted 
damage to the starboard propeller blades during a July 2013 in -water survey.  This damage 
had not been seen in an August 2012 survey so DNV determined  that the damage had 
occurred some time between August 2012 and July 2013. The damage sustained by the

Final report MO -2013 -203 
<< Page 31 >>
 blades of the starboard propeller was likely to have induced increased uniaxial bending forces 
on the propeller and shaft.  
9.2.4.  The tail shaft had fatigue cracks that corresponded with blade A, directly opposite the origin of 
the main fracture, which corresponded with the trailing edge of blade C.33  This would suggest  
additional  bending forces on the tail shaft.  However, as previously mentioned, these  bending 
forces would not usually cause fatigue  cracking without the surface of the shaft having first 
been weakened by corrosion and fretting.  It is very likely  that the variation in blade pitch was 
a significant factor in propagating the fatigue crack once it had been initiated.  
 Cavitation as a resu lt of variation in propeller blade pitch  
9.3.1.  The ‘cavitation number’ of a propeller indicates the degree of cavitation from a propeller or its 
tendency to cavitate.  The lower the cavitation number, in general, the more likely the propeller 
is to cavitate und er certain operating conditions.  But any deviation from the ‘as -designed’ 
propeller could make the propeller more susceptible to cavitation.   
9.3.2.  According to the initial design study produced by Wärtsilä, the Aratere ’s new propellers had a 
lower cavitation number than the old ones.  Thus the ‘new’ propellers were operating closer to 
the point of cavitation than the ‘old’ propellers.  
9.3.3.  Erosion  from cavitation was seen on the rudders at the first dive survey following the fitting of 
the new propellers on the Aratere.34 The blades on the ‘new’ starboard propeller as 
manufactured had deviated from the design pitch (as illustrated in Appendix 3), so it is likely 
that they were cavitating to some degree from the time the propeller was fitted.35  
9.3.4.  The design of the propeller meant that a relatively small amount of damage or deviation from 
the designed pitch could significantly affect the amount of cavitation from a blade.  Blade C of 
the starboard propeller showed more damage and a greater degree of  cavitation erosion  than 
the other blades (see Figure 10 and section 9.4 Extent of cavitation scouring on the rudders ). 
The observed damage and erosion  indicate d that  blade C could have induced a greater 
vibration load on the tail shaft. Quest noted:36 
Cavitation damage [ erosion ] was seen on all the blades on the recovered 
propeller to some extent. This indicates that the blades are probably designed to 
operate close to the operational reg ion where cavitation will occur. This was as 
reported in the design of the blades.  As a result, it may be possible that relatively 
small changes in the blade shape could make significant changes to the 
cavitation seen on a blade . 
9.3.5.  The extent of cavitation erosion  on the port propeller was less than that on  the starboard 
propeller.  When KiwiRail dry -docked the vessel in Singapore after the incident, Quest 
reported:37  
The amount of suction surface cavitation pitting [erosion] on the port propeller was 
signif icantly less than seen on the starboard propeller  …  The extent of cavitation 
was similar to the profile predicted by Wartsila in report TDH 000003044 . [See the 
diagram at  the top of Figure 11, this report .]

 Final report MO -2013 -203 9.3.6.  The areas of cavitation erosion  generally coincide d with the areas of difference between the 
as-designed and the recovered propeller, including the damage sustained between 2012 and 
2013 (see Figure 11). The variation in the patina strongly suggest ed that, at some stage, the 
flow pattern around blade C had been  significantly different from the flow pattern around the 
other blades. If a resonant flutter had occur red in blade C as a result, this could have caused  
vibration stress in the shaft and explai ned the location of the fatigue crack’s origin.38  
9.3.7.  Aurecon produced a three -dimensional laser surface scan of the propellers (see Figure 12). 
KiwiRail engaged MARIN to analyse the propeller forces and cavitation. MARIN’s analysis 
sought to calculate what cavitation would have resulted from the damaged propellers. MARIN 
concluded:  
The observed erosion pattern on the propeller blades would suggest the 
presence of a diverging trace of bubbles originating from the lead ing-edge.  A 
narrow ‘isolated’ band of sheet cavitation or a cavitating vortex is expected that 
is being shed from the leading -edge.  The results of the calculations show no 
traces of such narrow cavitation patterns starting from the leading -edge…39 
… The l ocation and shape of the computed sheet cavitation pattern cannot be 
linked to the observed damage on the starboard propeller blades…40 
… The calculations did not capture the supposed erosive cavitation forms that 
are likely responsible for the observed ero sion damage. This could be due to 
limitations to the applied calculations procedure, the representation of the 
propeller blade geometry and the assumed wake field of the ship.41 
9.3.8.  MARIN’s analysis was not useful for explaining the cavitation erosion  observed on the 
propellers and rudders.  MARIN acknowledged this was probably because the computer model 
was unable to map the propeller accurately or accurately predict the effects of the wake field 
coming from the stern of the ship.42

 Extent of cavitation scouring on the rudders  
9.4.1.  When the Aratere  dry-docked in Singapore it was found that the paint had scoured from the 
surface of the rudder in two distinct areas (see Figure 13 and Figure 14).  This scouring was 
characteristic of the effects of cavitation from the propeller.   
9.4.2.  The Commission reviewed the recordings from DNV’s in -water surveys carried out between the 
fitting of the ‘new’ propellers and the incident.  Cavitation scouring of the paint on the 
starboard rudder was evident in both recordings, which further suggest ed that  the starboard 
propeller had been cavitating from the time it had been fitted.  
9.4.3.  Cavitation scouring was also present on the port rudder but not to the extent seen on the 
starboard rudder.

 Cumulative effect  of forces acting on the Aratere ’s starboard propeller shaft    
9.5.1.  In its Final Report, Aurecon place d significant weight on the manufacturing of the propeller (in 
particular a malformed blade C) as the primary cause of the fatigue crack. The Commission 
determined that the new starboard propeller blades had been  producing uneven thrust and 
cavitating from t he time the propeller had been  fitted. However, the thrust and cavitation , by 
themselves,  were  unlikely to have been sufficient to propagate the fatigue crack.  
9.5.2.  The DNV records showed that the starboard propeller had suffered damage while in service on 
some  date between August 2012 and July 2013.  The evidence show ed that this damage 
resulted in a change in blade pitch for all four propeller blades.  Blades A, B and C had all 
been within the ISO tolerances when the propeller was built.  However, when measure d after 
the incident all three blades were found to be well outside the ISO tolerances (see Appendix 
3).  The areas of cavitation erosion seen on all four blades (Figure 11) generally coincided with 
the areas of difference in pitch between the propeller as  it had been  designed and when it 
was recovered after the incident, which makes it almost certain that the damage occurred in 
service, and not as a result of the incident.  
9.5.3.  It is very likely that the in -service damage to the propeller induced greater uniaxi al bending 
forces.  Also, it is very likely to have increased the cavitation and the consequential increase in 
vibration stress loading on the tail shaft.  
9.5.4.  In isolation, uneven thrust and cavitation should not result in catastrophic fatigue cracking in 
tail shafts , but the Aratere ’s starboard propeller shaft was in a weakened state as a result of 
fretting and corrosion. Uniaxial stress loading on the tail shaft would have likely increase d 
following in -service damage and, combined with cavitation, acted on th e weakened shaft to 
propagate the fatigue fracture until complete failure.

 Final report MO -2013 -203 Findings  
11. The starboard propeller blades varied from design specification and would 
have very likely been p roducing uneven thrust and cavitation from the time the 
new propeller was fitted.  The starboard propeller  had sustained damage in  
service between 2012 and 2013 , resulting in further variance in blade pitch.  
12. The variation in pitch between blades would very likely have induce d increased 
uniaxial bending forces in the tail sha ft, which acted on the weakened shaft to 
propagate  the fatigue crack.   
13. Cavitation from the starboard propeller would very likely have  contribute d to 
vibration stress loading on the tail shaft, but to what magnitude could not be 
precisely determined.

 Analysis: ISO standards for manufacturing tolerances  
 The manufacture of the Aratere  propellers  
10.1.1.  One of the most important factors in manufacturing a marine propeller to perform as 
predicted is to reproduce the shape in the original design as closely as poss ible. 
Manufacturers can use two methods to shape propeller blades: hand finishing or computer 
numerical control machines. The latter usually provides a more accurate finish.   
10.1.2.  Wärtsilä manufactured and hand finished the propellers that were fitted to the  Aratere  to 
within the tolerances of ‘ISO standard 484/1 -1981 Class I, high accuracy ’ (Class S, ‘very high 
accuracy’, was the only higher class of accuracy). So, for example, on the Aratere ’s propellers 
with a mean pitch43 of 4,571 mm, a tolerance of plus or minus 1.5% at each radius mean t the 
propellers’ actual pitch could be up to 68 mm different from the designed pitch and still be 
‘within tolerance’.  The propellers’ mean pitch is only allowed to deviate up to 0.75% from the 
designed value.  
10.1.3.  As previously mentioned, the ‘cavitation number’ indicates the degree of cavitation on a 
propeller or its tendency to cavitate.  The lower the cavitation number, in general, the more 
likely the propeller is to cavitate under certain operating conditions  (Eisenberg, 1950) .  But 
any deviation from the ‘as -designed’ propeller could make the propeller more susceptible to 
cavitation.   
10.1.4.  According to the initial design study produced by Wärtsilä, the Aratere ’s ‘new’ propellers were 
designed for highe r efficiency and thus had a  lower cavitation number than the ‘old’ ones. 
Thus the ‘new’ propellers were operating closer to the point of cavitation than the ‘old’ 
propellers  under normal operating conditions . 
 ISO standards  
10.2.1.  The ISO sets standards for the ma nufacturing tolerances of the type of propellers that were 
fitted to the Aratere . The relevant ISO standard is ‘Standard 484/1 Shipbuilding – Ship screw 
propellers – Manufacturing tolerances – Part 1: Propellers of diameter greater than 2.50 m’ 
(referred t o in this report as ‘ISO standard 484/1’).  
10.2.2.  ISO standard 484/1 came in  to force in 1981. It set four accuracy classes, which were to be 
selected by the customer.  Several tables set out the indications as to the accuracy (see 
Appendix 2 for full details).  However, propeller design and manufacture has evolved since 
1981. Propellers have become more efficient. However,  as a propeller’s efficiency increases it 
operates closer to the point where it would cavitate.  These high -efficiency propellers therefore 
require high -accuracy manufacture with small tolerance limits to ensure  that performance is 
maintained and they do not cavitate. It is possible  that the tolerances contained in ISO 
standard 484/1 are too wide for modern, high -efficiency propellers.  
10.2.3.  The Commi ssion has made a recommendation to Standards New Zealand to forward the 
report to the ISO Secretariat for its information on whether the current standards for 
manufacturing large -diameter marine propellers are appropriate for modern, high -efficiency 
propel lers that operate closer to cavitation margins.  
Finding  
14. The ISO standards for large -propeller manufacturing might not be suitable for 
more modern, high -efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation 
margins.   
                                                        
43 The pitch is the distance a propeller would move in one revolution if it were moving through a soft solid, like a screw thr ough wood. For 
example, a 21 -pitch propeller would move forward 21 units in one revolution

 Analysis : Other matters  
 Rudder stock cracking  
11.1.1.  As described above, in 2014 KiwiRail dry -docked the Aratere  after the incident  to refit the old 
propellers . While it was in dry -dock, KiwiRail found cracks in the starboard rudder stock .  
Examination of rudder stocks in dry -dock  
11.1.2.  While the Aratere  was in dry -dock after the incident , the port and starboard rudders were 
removed so the tail shaft s could be removed and refitted . When the tail shaft s had been 
reinstated and the rudders  were about to be refitted to the rudder stocks , a crack  was 
observed on the starboard rudder stock  (see Figure 15).  Further investigation found the 
rudder stock was cracked horizontally  on both the outboard and inboard faces.  An 
examination of the port rudder stock showed it was also cracked , but to a lesser extent.    
11.1.3.  KiwiRail had to replace the starboard rudder stock because the cracks were of a depth that 
could not be repaired.  KiwiRail decided to replace the port rudder stock also, even though it 
could have been repaired.

Final report MO -2013 -203 
<< Page 41 >>
 Cause of the cracking  
11.1.4.  KiwiRail engaged Matcor to determine the cause of the cracks found in both rudder stocks, 
with an emphasis on the starboard stock .  
11.1.5.  Matcor determined that because of their position and depth, the cracks were most probably 
linked to the forces applied to the starboard rudder by the cavitation from the starboard 
propeller (see Figure 14), rather than any  defects in the structure of the metal. These forces 
were likely to be outside those expected in normal operation s.  
11.1.6.  Matcor  stated that the fracture surface s of the cracks in the starboard rudder stock were :44 
generally flat with multiple fracture initiation sites along the shaft surface.  
Fractographic examination revealed that the fracture surface was generally smeared 
and corroded.  At some areas towards the crack tip, faint traces of striations could 
be disc erned.  The fracture features were generally consistent with fatigue crack 
propagation .  
11.1.7.  Quest agreed  that t he castellations on the crack s (see F igure 15) show ed that the crack s had 
formed due to separate smaller cracks joining together.  The crack was a m ulti–origined 
fatigue failure where the forces applied were well above the fatigue limit.  The crack may have 
stopped at the depth it reached due to the smaller diameter of the shaft , becau se a smaller -
diameter shaft needs more force applied to cause a cra ck.  The orientations of the cracks on 
the starboard shaft were  indicative that it wa s being forced from side to side.45   
11.1.8.  Quest determined , from an examination of the photographs of the rudder stock’s metal 
structure , that there did not appear to be any defects in the structure of the metal.  
 
Finding  
15. The cracks in the starboard rudder stock  were fatigue cracks. Owing  to their 
position and depth they were most probably linked to cavitation forces applied 
to the starboard rudder from the starboard propelle r. These forces were likely 
outside  those expected in normal operations.  
 Oversight of the fitting of new propellers  
11.2.1.  The r eplacement of the Aratere ’s propellers  was a modification to one of the ship’s critical 
systems .  The Commission found that advice fro m appropriate experts was either not sought 
or not followed during the fitment operation  to ensure that the propulsion system had been 
set up and functioning properly before the vessel re -entered service.  
Expert advice  
11.2.2.  In investigating the fitting of the new propellers, the Commission found examples of KiwiRail 
not following expert advice.  
11.2.3.  One example concerned KiwiRail’s decision to not follow Wärtsilä’s original advice to withdraw 
the tail shaft s to modify the tail sh aft bearings as a result of the lighter  propeller s. KiwiRail’s 
decision to not withdraw the tail shaft s led to the need to modify the propeller instead, and 
prevented its own propeller expert achieving full alignment of the tail shaft .

 Final report MO -2013 -203 11.2.4.  A second example w as KiwiRail’s decision to not follow Wärtsilä ’s advice to carry out torsional 
and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers. With respect to torsional vibration 
in propulsion systems, DNV wrote  (DNV -GL, 2016) : 
Keeping control of vibration levels in your engines, propulsion systems and 
generator sets is essential in order to have machinery that operates safe ly and 
reliably. The wrong combination of individually satisfactory components may lead 
to an inappropriate sy stem. The Torsional Vibration calculation software can 
identify the interaction between components, an essential part of the system and 
functionality assessment.  
11.2.5.  Wärtsilä had advised KiwiRail to carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting  the 
new propellers, but the Commission found no evidence that this was done. Wärtsilä carried 
out torsional and vibration calculations after the incident, and concluded, “The torsional stress 
and torque amplitudes are well within allowable levels in norma l operation ”. 
11.2.6.  When Wärtsilä designed the new propeller cone mentioned in previous sections, it again  
advised KiwiRail that a new torsional and vibration calculation would be required.  KiwiRail 
wrote to Wärtsilä advising that it had asked its own propeller expert to carry out the torsional 
and vibration calculation.  KiwiRail  was unable to produce those  calculations.  
Documentation  
11.2.7.  The r eplacement of  the Aratere ’s propellers was part of a wider project to lengthe n the ship 
and mo dify its bow and stern to improve sea -keeping characteristics.  The fitting of new 
propellers was on ly a part of this wider project; n evertheless, a ship’s  propulsion system is a 
critical one.  It is complex , made up of many components that must be compati ble for the 
system as a whole to work efficiently and safely.  
11.2.8.  Given the complexity of propeller replacement and the critical nature of the propeller system, 
the Commission expected to  be provided with  records of KiwiRail’s  decision -making process 
and tech nical documentation  prior to and during  the fitment of the new propellers . However, 
KiwiRail was unable to provide documentation for:  
 the decision -making process to re -propeller the Aratere   
 the design brief  
 specifications and standards for the propellers  (other than the design proposed by Wärtsilä)  
 verification that Wärtsilä’s design for the propeller was suitable for its intended use  
 verification that a proper fit had been achieved between both  propeller s and the tail shaft , 
despite engaging the DNV classification society to observe the fitting.   
11.2.9.  This lack of documentation from  KiwiRail mean t the Commission had no evidence that 
appropriate checks and balances had been  in place to ensure that the new propellers were 
well fit ted.  As described in this report, the  Commission considers it likely  that several adverse 
conditions  occurred  in the Aratere ’s starboard propulsion system  shortly  after the new 
propellers were fitted .  
  
Finding   
16. A lack of documentation from  KiwiRail mean t that the Commission had no 
evidence  that appropriate checks and balances had been  in place to ensure  
that the new propellers were well fitted . 
17. KiwiRail did not follow the manufacturer’s advice on the best way to fit the new 
propellers  and modify the propul sion system for optimum results .  If it had, 
some of the conditions that contributed to the failure of the tail shaft would 
have been less likely to occur.

 Analy sis: S ummary  
12.1.  Various experts concluded46 that the fracture that occurred on the  Aratere ’s starboard 
propeller shaft was a fatigue fracture, typical of that resulting from uniaxial bending forces.  
Such fractures begin with a crack in the surface of the metal that then propagat es to the 
point where the metal can no longer withstand normal ope rating loads.  
12.2.  For the crack to have initiated, the tail shaft must have been weakened.  The Commissio n 
found clear evidence that fretting had occurred between the bore of the port and starboard 
propeller hubs and their respective tail shaft s.  This fr etting, together with the presence of 
minor surface corrosion on both tail shafts, would  have decreased the fatigue strength of the 
tail shafts, making them more susceptible to fatigue cracking due to uniaxial (bending) forces.  
The most likely reason for the fretting was the quality of the fit achieved between the propeller 
hubs and the tapered section of the tail shaft s when the new propellers were fitted during the 
extension project in 2011.  
12.3.  The Commission found it likely that the fit of the propel lers was less than optimal, and that 
there was an increased risk of  damage to contact surfaces. Any damage to the contact 
surfaces  could  have  initiate d fatigue cracking on the surface of the tail shaft .  Any in-service 
movement resulting from the sub -optim al fit would  have  very likely caused the fretting .  
12.4.  The main types of force acting on the tail shaft  would have been uniaxial bending forces  and 
vibration. These forces would have acted on the weakened tail shaft  to propagate the crack. 
The Commissio n found measurable differences between the port and starboard propeller 
systems , showing that greater uniaxial forces were acting on the starboard propeller shaft.  
12.5.  Measurable differences between the port and starboard propulsion systems  that indicated 
increased vibration were:  
 the misalignment of the entire starboard propeller shaft was worse than that for the port 
side 
 the starboard propeller cavitation was worse than that of the port propeller  
 the starboard propeller had been damaged in ser vice, causing a further variation in average 
blade pitch (which would  likely have increased cavitation on the starboard side).  
12.6  The Commission found no evidence of errors in design or manufacture or excessive forces 
acting on the tail shaft. Neverthele ss, it fractured. None of the factors discussed in this report 
should, alone, h ave caused a well  designed tail shaft maintained in good condition to fail.  
The tail shaft must therefore have been in a weakened state for the fatigue crack to initiate.  
Conv ersely, the tail shaft being weakened due to fretting and corrosion should not, alone, 
have caused the tail shaft to fracture.  It required sufficient, albeit reduced, bending force to 
initiate the fatigue crack.  
12.7.  In combination , the weakened state o f the tail shaft and the levels of bending forces  resulted 
in the failure of the tail shaft.

 Final report MO -2013 -203 
 Findings  
13.1 The fracture was determined to be a fatigue fracture resulting from uniaxial bending forces.  
13.2 There had to be a source or sources present that produced bending forces capable of 
propagating the fatigue crack through the tail shaft.  
13.3 Based on the physical evidence, the reason for the fretting was likely to have been the quality 
of the fit achieved b etween the tapered propeller tail shaft and the propeller hub when the 
new propeller was fitted during the extension project.  
13.4 Fretting between the starboard propeller hub and the tail shaft and corrosion on the metal 
surface of the tail shaft would have  likely decreased its fatigue strength.  
13.5 It is likely that the fatigue crack occurred after the new propellers were fitted as there were no 
signs of wear on the old starboard propeller.  
13.6 It is unclear what DNV’s role or responsibilit y was in respect of the fit ting process and whether 
that responsibilit y was  met, as there were no formal records made. This also meant that it was 
not possible to determine the quality of the fitting process.   
13.7 Tail shaft lateral vibration and/or torsional vibration was unlikely to have been a major 
contributor to the fatigue cracking.  However, if it were present it would have affected the area 
of the tail shaft where the fracture occurred.  
13.8 The propeller shafts on the Aratere  had a history of misalignment and associated failures tha t 
could  be expected to result from such misalignment.  
13.9 Neither the port nor the starboard propeller shafts were well aligned when the new propellers 
were fitted during the extension project. The misalignment of the starboard shaft was worse 
than that of the port shaft.  This misalignment would have  likely contributed to vibration within 
the tail shaft area, although this factor alone should not necessarily have caused the tail shaft 
to fracture.  
13.10  The method of fitting the cone to the starboard propeller was n ot in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The Commission could not determine whether the cone was in 
line with the tail shaft and propeller. If it was not in line, it would likely have caused minor 
vibration to the tail shaft in the region whe re it cracked. This factor alone would not have 
caused the tail shaft to fracture . 
13.11  The starboard propeller blades varied from design specification and would have very likely 
been producing uneven thrust and cavitation from the time the new propeller was fi tted.  The 
starboard propeller sustained damage in  service between 2012 and 2013 , resulting in further 
variance in blade pitch.  
13.12  The variation in pitch between blades would  very likely have induced abnormal uniaxial 
bending forces in the tail shaft , which a cted on the weakened shaft to propagate the fatigue 
crack.   
13.13  Cavitation from the starboard propeller would  very likely have contributed to vibration stress 
loading on the tail shaft, but to what magnitude could not be precisely determined.  
13.14  The ISO standard s for large -propeller manufacturing might not be suitable for more modern, 
high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins.   
13.15  The cracks in the starboard rudder stock were fatigue cracks. Owing  to their position and 
depth they were mos t probably linked to cavitation forces applied to the starboard rudder 
from the starboard propeller. These forces were likely outside those expected in normal 
operations.  
13.16  A lack of documentation  from  KiwiRail mean t that  the Commission had no evidence that 
appropriate checks and balances had been  in place to ensure that the new propellers were 
well fitted.

 Recommendations  
 General  
15.1.1.  The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of  recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to Standards New Zealand  and 
KiwiRail . 
15.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
 Recommendations  
To the Chief Executive of KiwiRail  
15.2.1.  The r eplacement of a large vessel’s key components, such as propellers, is a significant 
undertaking. The Commission expected that KiwiRail would be able to provide comprehensive 
records from the process to fit the new propeller on the Aratere , including confirmation of the 
fit achieved.  KiwiRail provided only limited documentation.    
15.2.2.  Fitment of the propeller was found to have likely caused weakening of the propeller shaft due 
to fretting.  The lack of doc umentation means there is limited evidence about the quality of 
final fit achieved when the starboard propeller was replaced.  Documentation or records could 
have confirmed important details about the fitment process.  
15.2.3.  The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure that where KiwiRail 
makes significant  modifications to vessels, appropriate oversight is in place. Oversight 
includes keeping comprehensive records to demonstrate  that components  are safe and 
reliable  and compl y with the appropriate standards. [ 014/15]  
On 6 December 2016 , KiwiRail replied:  
We have already implemented your recommendation by ensuring that all 
significant modifications to vessels are now always undertaken under the 
oversight of KiwiRail’s Project Management Office which has its own strong project 
management disciplines including good records’ management and strong 
governance.  
To Standards New Zealand  
15.2.4.  The propellers were designed for high levels of efficiency and consequently had a low 
cavitation nu mber.  This means they were operating close to the point where they would 
cavitate in normal operations.  As a result, it may be possible that relatively small changes in a 
blade shape will make significant changes to the cavitation seen on the blade.  
15.2.5.  The propellers were manufactured to ISO standard 484/1 -1981 Class I (high accuracy ).  This 
standard came in  to force in 1981 and set accuracy classes that were to be selected by the 
customer.  
15.2.6.  Propeller design and manufacture evolved after ISO standard 484/1 ca me into existence in 
1981 , with a tendency towards more efficient propellers for owners to access  the benefits of 
less power being lost within the propulsion system.  However, as propellers became more 
efficient they were designed with a lower cavitation n umber, which means that during normal 
operations they were closer to the point where they would cavitate.  Any deviation from the 
design during manufacture would alter a propeller’s susceptibility to cavitate.  
 

<< Page 48 >>
 Final report MO -2013 -203 15.2.7.  The tolerances contained in ISO standard 484/1  may not be as relevant for modern , high-
efficiency propellers requiring high -accuracy manufacture with very small tolerance limits to 
ensure that their performance is not adversely affected.   
15.2.8.  The Commission recommends that Standards New Zealand submit th e Transport Accident 
Investigation Commission’s report MO -2013 -203 DEV Aratere , Loss of propeller , Cook Strait, 5 
November 2013 to the ISO Secretariat for its information  and to consider  whether the current 
standards for manufacturing large -diameter marine propellers are appropriate for modern, 
high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins.  [015/15]  
On 21 November 2016, Standards New Zealand replied:  
I can confirm t hat Standards New Zealand will implement the Commission’s final 
recommendation as soon as we have received the Commission’s final report.  I 
can also confirm that, as requested, I will send the commission a further letter 
following implementation of the re commendation.

 Comparison Port and Starboard Propellers  
 
Root mean square error of port and starboard propeller pitch es as manufactured when compared to designed pitch  
The X axis in Figure 1 shows the results for each blade – A, B, C, D . 
The Y axis in Figure 1 shows, as an absolute percentage, how much the ‘as manufactured’ propeller blade pitch deviates from d esign. For example: the average pitch 
of blade A on the port side propeller deviates from design by about 0.3%, whereas blade A of the starboard propeller deviates from design about 0.6%. The percentage 
was calculated using the Root Mean Square Error method described below.  
Figure 1 shows that generally the port and starboard propellers deviate d from design  by about the same amount , although it remains to be seen whether or not this 
magnitude of deviation from design is significant.  
The method used to calculate the Root Mean Square Error is described with the following equation:  
𝑅𝑜𝑜𝑡  𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛  𝑆𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒  𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟 =√1
𝑛∑(𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 )2𝑛
 
Where 𝑛 is the number of deviation measurements, and 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  is the measured deviation from design given as a percentage.  0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0

Note:
Deviation of “scanned” propeller surface from “designed” 
propeller surface. The magnitude of the deviation shown by the 
colours is absolute, and does not discern between a positive or 
negative deviation.
For example, the areas coloured red indicate that the “scanned 
propeller surface was between 10mm and 30mm from the 
“designed” surface, but does not necessarily indicate whether 
the “scanned” surface is in-front of, or behind the “designed” 
surface.
