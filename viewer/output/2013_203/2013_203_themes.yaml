- name: Propeller and Shaft Maintenance
  explanation: 'Propeller and shaft maintenance is a safety theme that involves the regular inspection, repair, and upkeep of the propeller and shaft components to ensure they are in good working condition and do not pose a risk to the vessel''s operation. This theme is relevant to the accident because the failure of the Aratere''s starboard propeller shaft was attributed to a fatigue fracture, which was likely exacerbated by the weakened state of the tail shaft due to fretting and corrosion. The Commission found evidence of fretting between the bore of the port and starboard propeller hubs and their respective tail shafts, which "would have decreased the fatigue strength of the tail shafts, making them more susceptible to fatigue cracking due to uniaxial (bending) forces" ("Findings" 13.2). Additionally, the lack of documentation from KiwiRail meant there was no evidence that appropriate checks and balances had been in place to ensure that the new propellers were well fitted ("Findings" 13.16).

- name: Adherence to Manufacturer's Recommendations
  explanation: "Adherence to manufacturer's recommendations is a safety theme that involves following the guidance and specifications provided by the equipment manufacturer to ensure the safe and proper installation and operation of components. This theme is relevant to the accident as KiwiRail did not follow the manufacturer's advice on the best way to fit the new propellers and modify the propulsion system for optimum results. Specifically, KiwiRail decided not to follow W\xE4rtsil\xE4's original advice to withdraw the tail shafts to modify the tail shaft bearings as a result of the lighter propellers, which led to the need to modify the propeller instead and prevented full alignment of the tail shaft (\"Analysis: Other matters\" 11.2.3). Furthermore, KiwiRail did not carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers as advised by W\xE4rtsil\xE4 (\"Analysis: Other matters\" 11.2.4).\n"
- name: Documentation and Record Keeping
  explanation: 'Documentation and record keeping is a safety theme that involves maintaining accurate and comprehensive records of maintenance, modifications, and inspections. This theme is relevant to the accident because KiwiRail was unable to provide comprehensive records from the process to fit the new propeller on the Aratere, including confirmation of the fit achieved. The lack of documentation means there is limited evidence about the quality of the final fit achieved when the starboard propeller was replaced ("Recommendations" 15.2.2). The Commission also noted the absence of records for the decision-making process to re-propeller the Aratere, the design brief, specifications and standards for the propellers, and verification that the propellers were suitable for their intended use and properly fitted ("Analysis: Other matters" 11.2.8).

- name: Vibration Analysis and Propulsion System Integrity
  explanation: "Vibration analysis and propulsion system integrity is a safety theme that involves assessing and monitoring the vibrations within the propulsion system to identify potential issues that could lead to mechanical failures. This theme is relevant to the accident as the Commission found that the misalignment of the entire starboard propeller shaft was worse than that for the port side, which would have likely contributed to vibration within the tail shaft area. Although this factor alone should not necessarily have caused the tail shaft to fracture, it was a contributing factor when combined with the weakened state of the tail shaft (\"Findings\" 13.9). Additionally, KiwiRail did not carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers as advised by W\xE4rtsil\xE4, which could have identified the interaction between components and helped prevent the failure (\"Analysis: Other matters\" 11.2.4).\n"
- name: Manufacturing Tolerances and Standards Compliance
  explanation: 'Manufacturing tolerances and standards compliance is a safety theme that involves ensuring that components are manufactured within specified tolerances and comply with current standards to guarantee their performance and safety. This theme is relevant to the accident because the Commission questioned whether the ISO standards for large-propeller manufacturing were suitable for modern, high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins. The propellers were manufactured to ISO standard 484/1-1981 Class I (high accuracy), but propeller design and manufacture have evolved since 1981, and the tolerances contained in ISO standard 484/1 may not be as relevant for modern propellers ("Analysis: ISO standards for manufacturing tolerances" 10.2.2). The Commission recommended that Standards New Zealand submit the report to the ISO Secretariat to consider whether the current standards are appropriate for modern propellers ("Recommendations" 15.2.8).

- name: External Expertise and Oversight
  explanation: "External expertise and oversight is a safety theme that involves seeking and incorporating the knowledge and supervision of external experts, especially when undertaking significant modifications to critical systems. This theme is relevant to the accident as KiwiRail did not follow expert advice during the fitment operation to ensure that the propulsion system had been set up and functioning properly before the vessel re-entered service. KiwiRail's decision not to follow W\xE4rtsil\xE4's advice to withdraw the tail shafts and not to carry out torsional and vibration calculations before fitting the new propellers are examples of the lack of external expertise and oversight (\"Analysis: Other matters\" 11.2.3, 11.2.4). The Commission recommended that KiwiRail ensure appropriate oversight is in place for significant modifications to vessels, including keeping comprehensive records (\"Recommendations\" 15.2.1)."
