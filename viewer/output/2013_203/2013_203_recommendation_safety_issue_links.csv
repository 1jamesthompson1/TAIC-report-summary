The Commission recommends that Standards New Zealand submit the Transport Accident Investigation Commissionâ€™s report MO-2013-203 DEV Aratere, Loss of propeller, Cook Strait, 5 November 2013 to the ISO Secretariat for its information and to consider whether the current standards for manufacturing large-diameter marine propellers are appropriate for modern, high-efficiency propellers that operate closer to cavitation margins",,"The quality of the fit achieved between the tapered propeller tail shaft and the propeller hub when the new propeller was fitted during the extension project was likely to have been the reason for the fretting.

Owing to their position and depth, they were most probably linked to cavitation forces applied to the starboard rudder from the starboard propeller. These forces were likely outside those expected in normal operations.
