Themes/causes present in the report:

1. Human factors: The accident was caused by the skipper's haste, distraction, and wearing loose clothing, which led to them becoming entangled in the trawl warp. Human error and behavior played a significant role in the accident.

2. Lack of hazard identification and control: The hazard of climbing over moving machinery had been identified but not adequately assessed and controlled. The operator failed to address this hazard in their hazard register and did not implement measures to reduce the risk.

3. Inadequate risk management: The report emphasizes the importance of thorough hazard identification and effective risk management. The operator did not adequately manage the risk associated with accessing the wheelhouse and controlling the winches, leading to the accident.

4. Lack of emergency stop: The absence of an emergency stop for the winch motor hindered the skipper's ability to stop the winches and potentially reduce the severity of their injuries. The report suggests that having emergency stops in key working areas could have prevented or mitigated the accident.

5. Procedural and technical changes: The operator has implemented safety actions, such as constructing a platform over the warping drums and amending procedures to forbid crew accessing the wheelhouse through the side doors during operation. They are also exploring technical and procedural changes to ensure better control of the winches in emergencies.

6. No evidence of mechanical or equipment failure: The investigation found no evidence of mechanical or equipment failure contributing to the accident. The focus of the report is on human factors and safety management rather than technical issues.
