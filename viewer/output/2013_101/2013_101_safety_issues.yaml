- The incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff. Independently, both locomotives were performing correctly, but the incomplete electrical connection meant they were not operating together. The incomplete electrical connection resulted in the two locomotives only intermittently operating together. It was this poor locomotive performance that ultimately led to the train being unnecessarily declared as disabled at Glenbrook.
- Driver B was able to set the brake handles incorrectly because there was no interlock capability between the two driving cabs of the DL-class locomotives. The incorrect brake set-up resulted in driver B not having brake control over the coupled wagons.
- "When the three staff members came together to couple the third locomotive to the disabled train at Glenbrook, no challenge and confirm actions were taken to complete a fundamental brake test procedure, which was designed to ensure that the trains\u2019 air brakes were functioning correctly."
- There were several procedural lapses by three experienced rail staff members between the coupling of the two locomotives at Auckland and the train examiner's dismounting from the train 12 hours later.
