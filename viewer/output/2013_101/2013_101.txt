The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendations to improve transport safety.   The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and 
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inquiries is to dete rmine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action a gainst a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents .

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. A KiwiRail freight train consisting of three locomotives hauling 3 6 wagons departed  Glenbrook  
bound for Mount Maunganui  at 0430 on  9 January 2013.  
1.2. When the train departed the brakes were working only on the three locomotives, and not the 
wagons (the train brake) due to the train braking system not being configured properly in the 
non-driving end of the lead locomoti ve.  Also , the coupling between the sixth  and seventh 
wagon s in the train had not been secured properly.  
1.3. The train parted between the sixth  and seventh  wagons  while descending a grade from 
Glenbrook .  Within a matter of seconds,  the rear portion of the tra in ran into the forward 
portion, causing the derailment . 
1.4. The track infrastructure  and 28 wagons carrying steel product w ere extensively damaged.  The 
line was closed for three and a half days while repairs were completed.  
1.5. The Transport Accident Investigation  Commission (Commission) found  that the train  was able 
to depart with a wrongly  configured brake control system due to there being no mechanical 
interlock  preventing it moving . 
1.6. The Commission also found  that the fact that the train brakes were not working when the train 
departed Glenbrook  should have been detected, but was not , because t he required brake test 
had not been performed after a third locomotive was added to the train.  
1.7. The Commission has made no recommendations  because of the safety actions  taken by 
KiwiRail Holdings Limited following th e derailment and the trend of decreasing mainline 
derailments during the period of this investigation.  
1.8. Key lessons  identified from this inquiry are:  
 train drive rs and train examiners need to comply with basic operating rules to ensure that 
trains have fully functioning and continuous air brake system s at all times  
 it is important that all operating staff  communicat e properly and effectively  and ensure 
that proper  procedures are followed .  Should there be any departure from the plan or any 
unusual or unexplained event occur , it must be communicated effectively  
 shift workers need to remain alert to any situation that could affect their cognitive 
performance, and that of their work colleagues.

 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. The NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission 
(Commission) of the dera ilment on 9 January 2013.   The Commission gathered further 
information, then on 14 January 2013 opened an inquiry under section 13(1) of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 and appointed an investigator in charge.  
2.2. An investigator trave lled to Hamilton on 15 January  2013 , where KiwiRail Holdings Limited 
(KiwiRail) had arranged re -enactment tests with the same three locomotives from the derailed 
train and some coupled wagons.  The re -enactment replicated the various brake control set -
ups as applied to the derailed train’s locomotives to determine the level s of brake application 
on the coupled wagon s. 
2.3. The investigator interviewed the two train drivers  involved in the occurrence , and the train 
examiner . A visit to the Mission Bush  rail termi nal was made  to gain an understanding of the 
circumstances leading up to the derailment.  
2.4. The Commission obtained recorded data from all three locomotives and the signalling system 
on the Mission Bush Branch line.  The two data streams were synchronised , and in 
conjunction with the train control diagram and voice recordings  were used to determine the 
sequence of events leading up to the derailment.  
2.5. The investigator also obtained a number of records and documents pertaining to the 
derailment:  
 training, certification, assessment and performance records  for the two train drivers and 
the train examiner  
 KiwiRail’s design for the brake handle set -up and the general build specifications for the 
DL-class  locomotive1 
 current and previous roster and tim esheet records for the two train drivers and the train 
examiner  
 KiwiRail’s rules pertaining to train brake testing and train drivers ’ responsibilities  
 driver B’s2 sleep patterns in the days leading up to the derailment  
 the results of the re -enactment tests  done at Hamilton in the week following the 
derailment  
 the safety actions taken by KiwiRail following the derailment  
 KiwiRail’s current non -technical skills3 policy and associated training material.  
2.6. On 23 February 2017  the Commission approved a draft repor t for distribution to interested 
persons for comment.  
2.7. Written submission s were received from five of the interested parties  between March and May 
2017.  The Commission considered the submissions, and changes as a result of those 
submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.8. On 24 May 2017 the Commission approved the final report for publication.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Locomotive and train coupling arrangements  
3.1.1.  There are three components used to join locomotives and wagons to form a train  (see 
Figure 1) .  The  components are: 
 electrical connection – this arrangement allows for one train driver to  operate multiple 
locomotives.  Electrical connections are used between locomotives only  
 coupler – this arrangement is th e physical connection between locomotives and between 
locomotives and wagons .  Couplers can be either automatic or standard mechanisms  
 brake hose s – these allow compressed air to transfer from locomotives to the coupled 
freight wagons on a train.   A train driver operates a valve in the locomotive cab  to 
decrease air pressure to apply brakes on every coupled locomotive and wagon .  
Conversely the train driver operates the valve to increase air pressure to release the 
brakes on every coupled locomoti ve and wagon on a train .

 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 3.2. The intermittent electrical connection  
3.2.1.  Between 1630 and 1650 on 8 January 2013, KiwiRail ’s locomotive servicing staff at Auckland 
coupled two diesel locomotives together  and recorded details of the air brake and electrical 
connection tests  that were carried out . 
3.2.2.  At 1630 on the same day a KiwiRail train driver (driver A) started work to drive the two 
locomotives from Auckland to Mission Bush, a distance of 50.5 kilometres ( km).  The 
locomotives left Auckland at 1718 (see Figure 2).  
Figure 2  
The two locomotives that travelled from Auckland to Mission Bush  (not to scale)  
3.2.3.  At 17 23 the Tranzlog4 event recorder s on the locomotives detected a n intermittent loss of 
connectivity in the electrical connection.  The electrical plug on the second locomotive  was 
later found not fully engaged  (see Figure 3) .  This result ed in the two locomotives not working 
together during the journey  to Mission Bush.  Driver A  was not aware of th e issue.  
  
Figure 3  
Examples of an engaged electrical p lug, left, and a not fully engaged plug , right  
3.2.4.  The two locomotives arrived at Mission Bus h at 1832  and were coupled to a rake of loaded 
wagons  to form freight Train 345 (the train) d estined for Mount Maunganui .  The train weighed 
1,845 tonnes , which was within the haulage capacity of the two locomotives.  Driver A 
transferred control of the train to the new lead locomotive (se e Figure 4) .

3.2.5.  Air compressors on the locomotives charged the brake cylinders to full pressure on the 
wagons throughout the train  after the brake hoses had been connected between the second 
locomotive and the first wagon . 
3.2.6.  Driver A, with assistance from a ground -based KiwiRail train examiner, conducted a detailed 
test of the train’s brakes in compliance with KiwiRail’s rules a fter ma ximum air pressure had 
been reached .  The procedure was  called a terminal brake test  and required the driver to 
releas e air pressure  from the brake cylinders , thereby apply ing the wagon brakes , then 
recharg e air pressure to  the brake cylinders to  release t he brakes .  The train examiner was 
also required to check that the coupl ers throughout the train were correctly secured.  
3.2.7.  The driver completed two basic tests during this time , which  showed  that the locomotive’s 
brakes were working correctly and , despite the intermittent  electrical plug  connection , that 
both locomotives were working together . 
3.2.8.  The train was moved in readiness for departure  from Mission Bush.  S hunting staff employed 
by the steel mill informed the train examiner  that they considered the two locomotives were 
not working  together during this movement .  The train examiner had become busy with other 
tasks and forgot to pass on this information to driver A.  
3.2.9.  Meanwhile, driver A had reached his own conclusion that his locomotive was not performing  
satisfactorily .  Although he  had walked pas t the area between the two locomotives on several 
occasions while at Mission Bush , he had not seen that the ele ctrical plug was not fully 
engaged on DC4352.  The two locomotives  were disconnected from the train and reoriented  
using a  triangular  track layout  provided for this purpose  and that negated the need to break 
the couple rs between the two locomotives  (see Figure 5) . 
 
Figure 5  
Reoriented Train 345  (not to scale)  
3.2.10.  The two locomotives were recoupled , and the brake hoses were reconnected  to the train by 
the train examiner .  The train driver and the train examiner conducted a shortened test on the 
train ’s brakes in compliance with KiwiRail’s rules.   The procedure , called an intermediate 
brake test , ensure d that the train’s brakes remained functioning  correctly .  The test was 
successful.

 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 3.2.11.  The train left Mission Bush at 2145 and took three and a half h ours to travel the 5.7 k m to 
Glenbrook , where driver A stopped the train.  Driver A thought that the slow speed was due to 
a fault in the lead locomotive.  Driver A had full braking control over both locomotives and the 
36 wagons during t his period.  
3.2.12.  The s eparate data streams from the Tranzlog event recorders on the locomotive s showed that 
the lead locomotive was hauling the train without any power coming from the second 
locomotive , as it would have done  if the electrical plug connection had been fully engaged .  
The train weight exceeded the lead locomotive’s pulling capacity .  Driver A had full control o f 
the locomotive s’ and wagon s’ brakes during this time.  
3.2.13.  At 0118 on 9 January 2013, d river A declared to train control that the train was disabled and 
needed additional locomotive power before the journey to Mount Maunganui could resume.  
3.2.14.  Another train driver tasked , who later in the day would be tasked with driving the three  non-
derailed locomotiv es away from t he derailment site , saw that the electrical connection was not 
fully engaged on the third locomotive.  He said that he was able to fully engage  and lock the 
electrical plug into its socket.  
3.2.15.  Servicing staff later reported that a detailed exami nation of the control systems on DL9141 
did not reveal any defects.  The locomotive was returned to train operations without any 
repairs being necessary.  
3.3. Setting t he brake control s 
3.3.1.  Train control arranged for an assisting (third) locomotive from Auckland.   It left Auckland with a 
Hamilton -based driver (driver B) at 0320 and travelled to Glenbrook , where it arrived at 0422 . 
3.3.2.  The third locomotive was coupled and the brake hoses were connected.  The train examiner 
had remained on duty and had driven by road from Mission Bush to Glenbrook to assist with 
the recovery of the disabled train . 
3.3.3.  The third locomotive now became the lead for the train (see Figure 6), but control had to be 
transferred to the driver’s cab at the other end of the locomotive.  An electrica l connection 
cable was plugged in between the two DL locomotives.  Th ese two locomotives now provided 
sufficient tractive power to enable the train to recommence its journey to Mount Maunganui.  
 
Figure 6  
Train 345 with the third locomotive  (not to scale)  
3.3.4.  Driver B was now in charge of the train , and he  transferred control to the other end of  the lead 
locomotive .  He did not neutralise the two brake handles  before he left the cab , leaving  the 
handles in the position s shown in Figure 7A.  The train would not move when driver B applied 
power  to the train . 
3.3.5.  Driver B returned to th e vacated cab and correctly neutralised the black handle  for the 
locomotive brakes , but omitted to neutralise the red handle for the train brakes (see 
Figure 7B). 
3.3.6.  In order to transfer control to the other driving cab correctly, Driver B should have placed both 
handles to the positions as shown in Figure 7C.

Figure 7  
The different brake handle set-ups 
3.3.7.  The incorrect brake set -up meant that driver B had braking control o n the three locomotives 
only, but no braking control on the 36 wagons .  An intermediate brake test required to be 
conducted from the lead locomotive in compliance with KiwiRail’s rules was not carried out.   
The intermediate test would have identified that there was no braking control on the wagons.  
3.3.8.  There was no loss of air pressure to the wagon ’s brakes  during this time , and the brake  
cylinders remained fully charged  and kept the brakes in the release position . 
3.3.9.  At 043 5 driver B  applied power and travel led a short distance on a slight rising gradient to a 
level crossing , where the train examiner dismount ed from the lead locomotive  to be near his 
parked motor vehicle .  Driver B noticed  that the train was not slowing as quickly as he 
expected because only the locomotive brakes were working.  The train examiner dismounted 
while the train was still moving . 
3.4. The derailment  
3.4.1.  At 0437 :02 driver B accelerated the train away from the level crossing.  At 0440  the speed of 
the train reached 63  km/h  on a descending gradient .  The driver applie d the train’s brakes to 
slow the train for an upcoming 40 km/h temporary speed restriction without success .  Driver B 
made several applications of the locomotives ’ brakes , but the speed  of the train increase d to 
76 km/h over the speed -restricted section of track.  
3.4.2.  At 0440:45 t he Tranzlog record ed a sudden drop in air pressure in the train ’s brakes .  The 
wagons had surged forward on the descending gradient , causing the coupling hook to lift up 
and t he brake hoses to separate b etween the sixth and seventh wagon s (see Figure 8) .

 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 3.4.3.  The bridle and coupling hook were later found to be intact on the separated sixth and seventh 
wagons.  It could not be established whether the bridle had been correctly secured between 
the two wagons before the train left Mission Bush or whether it had lifted off while the train 
was travelling between Mi ssion Bush and the location of the derailment.  It was normal 
practice for the train examiner to check that all bridles were in place before a train departed.  
3.4.4.  The two detached sections of the train travelled independently for a short distance.  
3.4.5.  At 0440:48  the rear section caught up and collided with the front section  of the train .  The 
Tranzlog s showed that the locomotives were travelling at 65 km/h  and c alculations showed 
that the rear section was travelling at 76 km/h at that instant .  The collision , known as a ‘run-
in’, cause d three wagons to derail  simultaneously in the vicinity of the 9.35 km mark , resulting 
in track damage that caused a further 28 wagons to derail.  
3.5. Rail personnel  
Driver A  
3.5.1.  Driver A was based in Auckland and his licen ce to drive trains was current.  He had been 
driving trains for 28 years.  He was familiar with the Mission Bush Branch line and the DL 
class of locomotive.  
3.5.2.  Driver A  had resumed work on 8 January 2013  after the Christmas  and New Year holiday 
period . 
3.5.3.  Driver A had been assessed  and passed competency for KiwiRail’s non-technical skills 
practices, alertness management and intermediate brake test procedures in 2012.  
3.5.4.  KiwiRail did not conduct a post -accident drug and alcohol test  on driver A in accordance with 
its own policy , which stipulated  that it would  test any member of staff directly involved in an 
incident . 
Driver B  
3.5.5.  Driver B was based in Hamilton and his licen ce to drive trains was current.  He had been 
driving trains for 39 years .  He was familiar with the Mission Bush Branch line and the DL 
class of locomotive.  
3.5.6.  Driver B’s  work hours during the preceding three weeks had been normal .  He had been 
rostered off duty for five days between 4 and 8 January 2013 , but he had been called out to 
drive overnight trains on two occasions.  Driver B said that he had suffered from restless sleep 
in the two nights immediately leading up  to the night of the derailment because of the 
prevailing hot and humid weather conditions.  
3.5.7.  Driver B had been assessed and passed competency for KiwiRail’s non-technical skills 
practices and alertness management during 2002.  His most recent intermediate brake test 
procedure assessment for competency had taken place  during 1999 . 
3.5.8.  Driver B underwent a post -accident drug and alcohol test, which detected no performance -
impairing substances.

 Train examiner  
3.5.9.  The train examiner was based in Mission Bu sh and his licen ce to operate was current.  He was 
familiar with train operating practices at Mission Bush and KiwiRail’s brake examination rules.  
The train examiner ’s work hours were normal . 
3.5.10.  The train examiner  had been assessed  and passed competency  for KiwiRail’s intermediate 
brake test procedures in 2012 , but he had not been trained in or assessed for K iwiRail’s non-
technical skills p ractices and alertness management practices.  
3.5.11.  KiwiRail did not conduct a post -accident drug and alcohol test  on the train examiner  in 
accordance with its own policy , which stipulated that it would  test any member of staff directly 
involved in an incident .

 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Mainline derailments have the potential to cause serious harm to people , and damage  to 
locomotives , wagons, rail infrastructure  and the freight being conveyed.   They therefore have 
significant implications for transport safety.   This derailment occurred close to occupied farm 
dwellings , and the extended recovery period disrupted production at the steel mill the Mission 
Bush Branch line served.  
4.1.2.  The actual derailm ent occurred after the train had separated when , seconds later, the rear 
portion of 30 wagons ran into the front six wagons and three locomotives.  Evidence showed 
that t he front portion of the train had slowed more quickly than the heavier rear portion of  the 
train , very likely because of the heav y weight of the 30 wagons and the three l ocomotives 
being already under braking . 
4.1.3.  The impact of the collision forced three wagons to derail simultaneously .  Driver A had not 
been able to apply the train’s brakes, b ut the  retained air pressure in the wagons ’ brake 
cylinders resulted in t he wagon brakes automatically appl ying on both portions of the train 
when the hoses separated  between the sixth and seventh wagons . 
4.1.4.  The separation between the sixth and seventh wagon s and was very likely caused by an 
incomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected during the terminal brake test 
undertaken at Mission Bush before the train  depart ed.  The incomplete coupling allowed the 
hook  to spring up when the coupling s suddenl y compressed as the train descend ed the 
gradient from Glenbrook . 
4.1.5.  The investigation did not uncover any mechanical faults with the wagons , any freight loading 
issues , or any track geometry iss ues that could have contributed to the derailment.   None of 
the three locomotives had any mechanical faults that made it unserviceable , except for the 
underlying brake handle issue on the DL locomotives.  Subsequent tests carried out on t he 
same three locomotives  showed that th e brakes on the wagons would not have functioned 
with the identical brake control configuration as set  when the train left Glenbrook . 
4.1.6.  The following analysis discusses the factors leading to the derailment , and safety issues 
relating to non -compliance with t rain operating practices.  
4.2. The train drivers’ and train examiner’s actions  
4.2.1.  Both train drivers and the train examiner were qualified  for the ir roles.  With the exception of 
driver B, they had recently demonstrated compliance with the intermediate brake test 
procedures.  
4.2.2.  Driver B’s most recent assessment for intermediate brake tests had been undertaken in July 
1999.  He was therefore  12 years overdue for his intermediate brake test assessment.  This, 
together with two other instances where driver A and the trai n examiner were overdue for their 
biannual theory assessments , has since been addressed by KiwiRail.  
4.2.3.  KiwiRail implemented an improved assessment management system for  its staff members  
during July 2014 .  The system now provides all levels of KiwiRail manag ement with a 
transparent overview of dates by which any  outstanding assessment s must be completed.  
4.2.4.  During the investigation the Commission identified the following procedural lapses by the 
locomotive servicing staff, the train drivers and the train examiner : 
 the electrical connection was not fitted correctly by the servicing staff prior to the two 
locomotives leaving Auckland  and was not subsequently identified or checked by driver A  
 the incomplete coupling between the sixth and seventh wagons was not detected during 
the terminal brake test prior to the train leaving M ission Bush  
 
Final Report RO -2013-101 
<< Page 11 >>
  the brake handles in the rear cab of the lead locomotive were left in an incorrect 
configuration . 
4.2.5.  The Commission reviewed KiwiRail ’s procedures and instructions for these t asks  and 
identified a number of improvements, which KiwiRail subsequently made.  
4.3. The incomplete electrical plug connection  
Safety issue – The incomplete electrical plug  connection went undetected by several rail staff.  
Independently, both locomotives were performing correctly , but the incomplete  electrical  
connection meant they were not operating together . 
4.3.1.  The incomplete electrical connection resulted in the two locomotives  only intermittently 
operating together .  It was this poor locomotive performance that ultimately  led to the train 
being unnecessarily declared as disabled at Glenbrook .  This was the first in a chain of events 
that led to the derailment.  
4.3.2.  Had driver A checked the electrical connection before leaving Mission Bush , it could have 
been rect ified by simply pushing home the plug on the second locomotive until the lug on the 
top flap locked into the depression at the top of the plug ( refer  Figure 3).  
4.3.3.  There  is no automatic alert to inform a train driver when  an electrical connection  is not fully  
engaged.  Train drivers use their experience to monitor the performance of multiple 
locomotives hauling trains . 
4.3.4.  The ammeters5 in the driving cab would have shown driver A that driving amps  were being 
generated for the traction motors  within the normal operat ing range  for both locomotive s.  This 
would have been an indication to the train d river that both were fully functional and that there 
was potentially a problem with the electrical connection between the two locomotives . 
4.3.5.  The servic ing staff and the train driver were qualified for their roles and all had experience in 
fitting and checking electrical connections bet ween locomotives .  KiwiRail reviewed its 
locomotive servicing procedures and used this derailment to highlight the need for train 
drivers to include visual examination s of electrical connection s when dealing with  any similar 
locomotive performance issues .  Consequently, t he Commission has not made any 
recommendations to KiwiRail to address this issue.  
4.4. Incorrect brake handle  set-up 
Safety issue – Driver B was able to set the brake handles incorrectly because there was no 
inter lock6 capability between the two driving cabs of the DL-class locomotive s.  The incorrect 
brake set -up resulted in  driver B not having brake control over the coupled wagons . 
4.4.1.  The DL-class  locomotive was  the first double -cab diesel locomotive to operate in New Zealand 
that had brake handles permanently fitted to both cabs.   It required train drivers to set the  
locomotive  and train brake handles correctly before vacating a cab and relocating to the cab 
at the other end.  
4.4.2.  In comparison , the e arlier -generation double -cab diesel  and electric locomotives , and the 
current fleet of double -cab EF -class electric locomotives , required some  or all of the brake 
handles  to be physically transferred by the drivers when changing ends.   This meant that train 
drivers had to isolate the brakes in a cab being vacated in order to remove the appropriate 
handles .  The handles were then carried to the other cab , where th ey were inserted to allow 
                                                        
5 An ammeter is a dial fitted on a locomoti ve’s dashboard to display the amount of current being produced by 
the electrical generator.

in this instance, cannot be independently operated at t he same time . 
 

<< Page 12 >>
 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 the brakes  to be controlled from that end of the locomotive .  This manual process provided a  
reliable  interlock , prevent ing an incorrect brake handle set -up as seen in this instance . 
4.4.3.  KiwiRail investigated several options before choosing the Tranzlog event recorder system to 
provide an interlock capability  to prevent a similar incident .  The Tranzlog system was chosen 
to perform  this interlock b ecause the positions of the brake handles were  already being 
monitored by the system.  This option was successfully t ested during 2014/2015 and rolled 
out on all the DL-class  locomotives.  In view of this work, t he Commission has not made a 
recommendation to KiwiRail to address this issue.  
4.4.4.  Additionally , KiwiRail has committed to provid ing a similar Tranzlog -based interlock capability  
on all its other mainline diesel locomotives .  This work will supplement the existing manual 
interlock and was underway at the time of the compilation of this report.  
Finding s 
1. The train departed Gl enbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating.  The 
brakes on all of the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver 
had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly when changing from one 
driving cab to the other.  
2. The driver was ab le to depart with a wrongly configured brake system because 
there was no mechanical interlock to prevent his doing so.  
3. The required pre -departure train brake test would have revealed that the train 
brake was not operational, but those involved omitted to p erform the test when a 
third locomotive was attached to the train.  
4. The train parted when a coupling that had not been fully secured allowed the 
hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train 
descended the gradient from Glenbrook . 
5. The derailment was caused by the rear portion of the train colliding with the 
forward portion seconds after the train parted.  
4.5. Non-technical skills  
Safety issue  – When the three staff members came together to couple the third  locomotive to 
the disabled train at Glenbrook, no challenge and confirm action s were taken to complete a 
fundamental brake test procedure , which was designed to ensure  that the trains ’ air brakes 
were functioning correctly.  
4.5.1.  Non-technical skills (previously known as crew resource managemen t) are a set of practices 
designed to create a safe working environment, encourage teamwork, improve situational 
awareness and understand technical proficiency . 
4.5.2.  Staff using non-technical skills will communicate more effectively , be more aware of their 
situation, use all of its available resources  and work better with one another.   Communication 
skills and practices form a significant component of what has become known as non -technical 
skills in other transport modes.  
4.5.3.  The issue of non -technical skills was raised in seven rail occurrence reports published by the 
Commission between 2003 and 2008.  Recommendations were made to KiwiRail to establish 
non-technical skills as a core operating practice to help reduce accidents and incidents within 
the rail industry . 
  
 
Final Report RO -2013-101 
<< Page 13 >>
 4.5.4.  The Commission had issued its most recent recommendation on non -technical skills to the NZ 
Transport Agency during 2012.  The recommendation required  that the practice of non -
technical skills be recognised in the National Rail System Standard s.  The re commendation 
remained open at the time of compiling this report.  
4.5.5.  In this instance, t he non -technical skill lapses were  that: 
 the comments by mill shunting staff regarding the two locomotives not working 
together were not communicated  
 the required intermedi ate brake test was not carried out when the third locomotive 
was attached to the train at Glenbrook.  
4.5.6.  The train examiner forgot to pass on the information to the train driver after the mill shunting 
staff had identified that the locomotives did not seem to be working together.  The mill 
shunting staff were alert to the problem , and had the train examiner informed driver A of what 
he had been told, the driver  may have been prompted to examine the electrical connection 
and could have  found  that it was not properly connected.  
4.5.7.  If driver A had corrected the electrical connection, the train would have had sufficient 
locomotive power without the addition of the third locomotive . 
4.5.8.  KiwiRail’s air brake rules stated that an intermediate brake test was required when a 
locomotive was added to a train.  The straightforward  test involved t he train examiner 
position ing himself alongside any wagon  on the train to observe the movement of the piston in 
the brake cylinder when driver B applied and released the train ’s brakes  from the lead 
locomotive . 
4.5.9.  In this case the train examiner would have observed that the wagon’s  brake s were  not 
working .  This would have prompted driver B to re -examine his brake handle set -up.  The train 
would not then have departed with a non-operational  train brake.   Although driver B was 
responsible for ensuring compliance with this task, either driver A or the train examiner should 
have advised driver B that the intermediate test was required.  
4.5.10.  As a result,  there w as no braking control on the loaded wag ons that weighed a total of 1,845 
tonne s.  Driver B was unable to reduce  the speed of the train  and comply with the 40 km/h 
restriction  shortly  after leaving the level crossing at Glenbrook.  
4.5.11.  On 26 October 2016 KiwiRail provided the Commission with an updat ed implementation plan  
to develop non-technical skills within its workforce.  The plan stated that non -technical skills 
must be embedded and promoted in the workforce in order to build a strong safety culture.   
The plan showed that b etween 2014 and 2016 the following  number of KiwiRail staff had 
participated in training programmes that included the principles of non-technical -skills : 
2014  2015  2016  2017 
(proposed)  
337 502 638 625 
4.5.12.  On 14 December 2016 KiwiRail provided the Commission with a further update on its plan ned 
implementation of its non-technical skills policy in the management of its core business 
operations and practices.  KiwiRail said that current thinking internationally on the 
management of non -technical skills with in rail and other modal transport industries has 
shifted.  The new  policy  requires non -technical skills princip les to be embedded in all technical 
and non -technical training, safety assessments/observations/aud its and assurance activities 
within an organisation ’s safety management and crew management systems.  
4.5.13.  KiwiRail has referred to extensive material produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board  
Limited and Network Rail in the United Kingdom.  KiwiRail said that this approach was  a big 
step forward  because it had to have organisational alignment across all of its business groups 
and not be restricted to above rail , as was the case when non-technical skills practices were 
first delivered during the mid -1990s.  

<< Page 14 >>
 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 4.5.14.  KiwiRail said that o ther work done in the risk management of SPADs (signals passed at 
danger) had seen the development and implementation of a  stabilised approach, risk- 
triggered commentary driving and engineering supervisory controls within its safety 
management systems .  These actions were  designed to support train driver cognition, trap 
human error before an accident and enable recovery to a safe condition.  
4.5.15.  These plans show that KiwiRail is continuing  to address non -technical skills awareness and 
therefore the Commission will not be making a further recommendation on this matter.  
Meanwhile, t he Commission ’s recommendation  002/12 made  to the NZ Transport Agency in 
2012  remains open . 
4.5.16.  On 3 April 2017 the  NZ Transport Agency said that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail on 
this issue.  The agency added that it had issued a safety improvement plan notice during 
December 2016 in accordance with section 36 of the Railways Act 2005 , requiring KiwiRail to 
prepare a safety improvement plan to address the implementation of non -technical skills in its 
rail operations.  
Finding  
6. There were several opportunities to break the chain of events leading to the 
derailment.  However, non -technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource 
management) were not being used to good effect.  
4.6. The train drivers ’ and train examiner ’s performance  
Safety issue – There were several  procedural lapses by three experienced rail staff members  
between the coupling of the two locomotives at Auckland and the train examiner ’s 
dismounting from the train 12 hours later . 
4.6.1.  The Commission has considered whether  fatigue w as a contributory factor  in respect of both 
drivers and the train examiner not carry ing out the intermediate brake test.  
4.6.2.  Driver A was working his second day after a period of leave and the train examiner had been 
off duty for the preceding weekend.  They had started work the previous evening at 1630 and 
1745 respectively and said they had been feeling tired when it came to coupling the third 
locomotive to the train at Glenbrook.  
4.6.3.  However, based on driver A ’s and the train examiner ’s hours of work and their comments, it 
was very unlikely that either of these two member s was suffering from fatigue.  
4.6.4.  On the other hand, driver B reported suffering restless sl eep during the three days leading up 
to the derailment.  Although he reported feeling well when he started work at midnight  on 8 
January 2013, he overlooked the setting of the brake handles  only four and a half hours later . 
4.6.5.  Driver B s aid that he had not rested well and his sleep had been light and restless.  It was 
highly likely that he was suffering from a level of sleep iness  and was tired before starting the 
night shift .  It was unlikely t hat he had reached a level of fatigue  based on his hours of work 
leading up to the derailment and from his comments . 
4.6.6.  The procedural lapses occurred during the period when circadian rhythm is at its lowest7.  Not 
checking the correct setting of the brake ha ndles and not calling for an intermediate brake 
test occurred at precisely 0430, the time when  cognitive performance  is typically at its lowest . 
  
                                                        
7 The time in the natural body clock when performance is at its lowest and the drive for sleep is at its highest.  
 
Final Report RO -2013-101 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.6.7.  Research by sleep/wake experts8 has show n that t he period between 0300 and 0500, and 
specifically 0430, is when a person’s body reaches its lowest temperature , which in turn leads 
to reduced cognitive performance.  Recognising that  two procedural lapses occurred during 
this critical period, it may help to explain some of the shortcomings, particularly the need for 
driver B to call for an intermediate brake test . 
4.6.8.  The Commission published six rail occurrence reports into freight train derailments and 
collisions during a two-year period between September 2000 and July 2002.  Two of the 
themes identified in the repo rts were:  
 train driver roster management  
 recognising the difficulties of train drivers attaining good -quality sleep during summer 
months.  
The Commission published , and repeated , four recommendations in those six reports to Tranz 
Rail (the penultimate prede cessor to KiwiRail) to address these issues.  The four 
recommendations were subsequently closed out after the Sleep /Wake Research Centre in 
Wellington developed a best -practice policy for rostering train drivers.  
4.6.9.  On 1 December 2013 KiwiRail and the Rail an d Maritime Transport Union issued a document 
titled ‘Summer SPAD Awareness ’.  The document identified that the summer months 
(December –February) were among the worst for SPADs and other safety -related incidents.  
4.6.10.  The purpose of the document was to raise awareness of the increased risks brought on during 
the summer months and offer advice to staff members on how to reduce the likelihood of 
incidents.  One topic addressed was fatigue and shift work.  The document identified that 
fatigue was exaggerated by the longer daylight hours and hotter temperatures reduc ing the 
ability for shift  workers  to obtain adequate rest , and the ability to get good sleep during the 
day. 
4.6.11.  Between October and December 2016, KiwiRail engaged with its train  operating staff and 
provided an update to its summertime fatigue management program me, address ing the 
increased risk of incidents occurring during this period.  The programme covered matters such 
as entering shifts prepared, situational awar eness and the ‘stop, think, act, review’ process.  
Based on the evidence supplied , the Commission has not made any further recommendations . 
Finding  
7. It is likely that the time of day, when  cognitive performance is at its lowest due to 
natural circadian rhyt hm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the 
performance of those involved in setting up and checking the train.  However, 
there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor .

<< Page 16 >>
 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 5. Findings  
5.1. The train departed Glenbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating.  The brakes on all of 
the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver had omitted to configure the 
brake levers correctly when changing from one driving cab t o the other.  
5.2. The driver was able to depart with a wrongly configured brake system because there was no 
mechanical interlock to prevent his doing so.  
5.3. The required pre -departure train brake test would have revealed that the train brake was not 
operational, b ut those involved omitted to perform the test when a third locomotive was 
attached to the train.  
5.4. The train parted when a coupling that had not been fully secured allowed the hook to spring 
up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train descended th e gradient from 
Glenbrook.  
5.5. The derailment was caused by the rear portion of the train colliding with the forward portion 
seconds after the train parted.  
5.6. There were several opportunities to break the chain of events leading to the derailment.  
However, non -technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource management) were not 
being used to good effect.  
5.7. It is likely that the time of day, when cognitive performance is at its lowest due to natural 
circadian rhythm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the performance of 
those involved in setting up and checking the train.  However, there was no evidence that 
fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor.

 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety  actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the r egulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. On 18 January 2013 KiwiRail  issued a Safety Briefing titl ed ‘Incorrect Brake Set-Up’.  The 
briefing explained the consequences if either the independent or the train brake handles were 
incorrectly set up on a freight train with any DL -class  locomotive in the lead position.  
6.3. On 5 May 2015 KiwiRail issued a Safety Briefing titled ‘Radio Test, Servicing and Brake Set -Up 
Card (Loco  387) ’.  The briefing detailed an update made to the Loco  387 form that required 
servicing st aff to sign off as a check that the brake handles ha d been correctly set when 
locomotives were coupled together for multiple operation on a train.  
6.4. On 15 June 2015 KiwiRail issued a special bulletin titled ‘Incorrect Brake Set -Up Protection 
Trial – DL9129 ’.  The bulletin explained that the Tranzlog system had been updated to provide 
incorrect -brake -set-up protection.  The trial period was scheduled for a six-week period.  
6.5. On 9 May 2016 KiwiRail issued a subsequent special bulletin titled ‘DL locomotives – Tranzlog 
Upgrade ’.  The bulletin explained that following the successful trials on DL9129, the Tra nzlog 
system upgrade would be rolled out to the remaining 39 DL-class  locomotives.  
6.6. On 1 2 August 2016 KiwiRail advised that all operational DL -class  locomotives had had the 
Tranzlog upgrades completed.  A small number of non -operational locomotives that were 
currently having asbestos removed at its workshop facility in the Hutt Valley near Wellington 
would have the Tranzlogs upgraded  when the repairs  were completed . 
6.7. On 12 August 2016 KiwiRail advised that the couplers in 34% of the fleet of freight wagons  
used to transport export steel had been converted from standard to automatic couplers to 
mitigate against coupler partings on moving trains  (see Figure 9).

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Repot RO -2013 -101 6.8. On 5 October 2016 KiwiRail advised that it was reviewing the Tranzlog upgrade designed to 
detect an incorrect brake set -up on the DL -class  locomotives with a view to installing the 
upgrade in its remaining single -cab diesel locomotive fleet.  
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.9. On 3 April 2017 the NZ Transport Agency said that KiwiRail  had improved its competency
