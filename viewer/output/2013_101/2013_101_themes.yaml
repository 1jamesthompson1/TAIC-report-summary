- name: Incomplete Coupling Connection
  explanation: The incomplete coupling connection is a safety theme that played a critical role in this accident. The report states that "the separation between the sixth and seventh wagons was very likely caused by an incomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected during the terminal brake test undertaken at mission bush before the train departed" (4.1.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This undetected incomplete coupling allowed the hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train descended the gradient from Glenbrook, leading to the train parting and the subsequent derailment (4.4, 5.4).
- name: Non-Technical Skills (Crew Resource Management)
  explanation: Non-technical skills, also known as crew resource management, are essential for ensuring safety in railway operations. The report highlights that "non-technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource management) were not being used to good effect" (5.6). Specifically, the failure to perform a fundamental brake test procedure after coupling a third locomotive at Glenbrook, which would have ensured that the train's air brakes were functioning correctly, is an example of a lapse in non-technical skills (4.5). The lack of effective communication and challenge and confirm actions among the staff members contributed to the chain of events leading to the derailment (4.5.5, 4.5.9).
- name: Brake System Configuration and Testing
  explanation: The brake system configuration and testing is a safety theme that was directly related to the accident. The report finds that "the train departed Glenbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating" because "the driver had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly when changing from one driving cab to the other" (5.1). Additionally, the required pre-departure train brake test, which would have revealed that the train brake was not operational, was not performed when a third locomotive was attached to the train (5.3). This oversight allowed the train to depart with a non-operational train brake, contributing to the inability to control the train's speed and the eventual derailment (4.5.9).
- name: Electrical Plug Connection
  explanation: The incomplete electrical plug connection is a safety theme that initiated the chain of events leading to the derailment. The report indicates that "the incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff" and resulted in the two locomotives only intermittently operating together (4.3). This poor locomotive performance led to the train being unnecessarily declared as disabled at Glenbrook, which was the first event in the chain leading to the derailment (4.3.1).
- name: Fatigue and Circadian Rhythm
  explanation: Fatigue and circadian rhythm are safety themes that can affect the performance of rail staff. The report discusses the possibility of fatigue as a contributory factor, noting that "it is likely that the time of day, when cognitive performance is at its lowest due to natural circadian rhythm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the performance of those involved in setting up and checking the train" (5.7). Although there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor, the procedural lapses occurred during the period when circadian rhythm is at its lowest, which may have affected cognitive performance (4.6.6, 4.6.7).
- name: Procedural Lapses and Compliance with Operating Practices
  explanation: Procedural lapses and compliance with operating practices are safety themes that encompass the actions of the train drivers and train examiner. The report identifies several procedural lapses, such as the incorrect fitting of the electrical connection by servicing staff, the incomplete coupling not detected during the terminal brake test, and the incorrect configuration of brake handles in the rear cab of the lead locomotive (4.2.4). These lapses indicate non-compliance with train operating practices and contributed to the derailment (4.6, 5.2).
