- name: Incomplete Coupling Connection
  explanation: The incomplete coupling connection between the sixth and seventh wagons was a critical factor in the derailment. This safety theme is relevant because the investigation found that "the separation between the sixth and seventh wagons was very likely caused by an incomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected during the terminal brake test undertaken at mission bush before the train departed" (4.1.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). The incomplete coupling allowed the hook to spring up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train descended the gradient from Glenbrook, leading to the train parting and the subsequent collision (4.4, 5.4).
- name: Non-Technical Skills (Crew Resource Management)
  explanation: Non-technical skills, also known as crew resource management, were identified as a safety theme because the staff did not effectively use these skills to ensure that the train's air brakes were functioning correctly. The report states that "no challenge and confirm actions were taken to complete a fundamental brake test procedure" (4.5), and "there were several opportunities to break the chain of events leading to the derailment. However, non-technical skills (otherwise known as crew resource management) were not being used to good effect" (5.6). The lack of effective communication and adherence to safety protocols among the crew members contributed to the derailment.
- name: Procedural Lapses by Rail Staff
  explanation: Procedural lapses by the rail staff, including the locomotive servicing staff, train drivers, and train examiner, were a significant safety theme. The report highlights several instances where procedures were not followed correctly, such as "the electrical connection was not fitted correctly by the servicing staff" (4.2.4), and "the required pre-departure train brake test would have revealed that the train brake was not operational, but those involved omitted to perform the test when a third locomotive was attached to the train" (5.3). These lapses in following established procedures were directly related to the accident.
- name: Incorrect Brake Handle Set-Up
  explanation: The incorrect brake handle set-up in the DL-class locomotives is a safety theme because it resulted in the driver not having brake control over the coupled wagons. The report states that "driver b was able to set the brake handles incorrectly because there was no interlock capability between the two driving cabs of the dl-class locomotives" (4.4 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)), and "The train departed Glenbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating. The brakes on all of the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver had omitted to configure the brake levers correctly" (5.1). This issue was a direct contributor to the derailment.
- name: Fatigue and Time of Day
  explanation: Fatigue and the time of day were considered as factors affecting the performance of the rail staff involved in the accident. The report suggests that "it is likely that the time of day, when cognitive performance is at its lowest due to natural circadian rhythm, and the length of time on shift were factors affecting the performance of those involved in setting up and checking the train" (5.7). Although there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor, the timing of the procedural lapses at 0430, a time known for reduced cognitive performance, is relevant to the accident (4.6.6, 4.6.7).
- name: Inadequate Detection of Electrical Plug Connection Issues
  explanation: The inadequate detection of electrical plug connection issues is a safety theme because the incomplete electrical connection between the locomotives went undetected and contributed to the train being declared disabled. The report notes that "the incomplete electrical plug connection went undetected by several rail staff" (4.3) and "the incomplete electrical connection resulted in the two locomotives only intermittently operating together" (4.3.1). This issue was the first in a chain of events that led to the derailment.
