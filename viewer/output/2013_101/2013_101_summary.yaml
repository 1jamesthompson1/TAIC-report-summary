- name: Fatigue Management
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Fatigue was considered as a potential factor affecting the performance of the train drivers and train examiner. Driver B reported restless sleep prior to the incident, and the procedural lapses occurred during a time when cognitive performance is typically at its lowest due to circadian rhythm. However, there was no evidence that fatigue due to accumulated sleep loss was a factor (4.6.7, 4.6.11, 5.7). The percentage is kept low because the report indicates that fatigue was not a significant contributor to the accident.
- name: Human Error and Assumptions
  percentage: 20
  explanation: Human error played a significant role in the accident. The driver omitted to configure the brake levers correctly, and the required pre-departure train brake test was not performed when a third locomotive was attached to the train (5.1, 5.3). Additionally, the incomplete coupling between the sixth and seventh wagons was not detected during the terminal brake test (4.1.4). These errors and assumptions about the state of the train's systems contributed significantly to the accident.
- name: Training and Competency
  percentage: 10
  explanation: While the staff involved were qualified, there were lapses in compliance with training requirements. Driver B was 12 years overdue for his intermediate brake test assessment (4.2.2). KiwiRail has since addressed this by implementing an improved assessment management system (4.2.3). The report suggests that while training and competency were factors, they were not the primary causes of the accident.
- name: Training and Familiarity with Equipment
  percentage: 5
  explanation: The report does not directly attribute the accident to a lack of training and familiarity with equipment. However, the incorrect brake handle set-up and the incomplete electrical plug connection suggest that there may have been issues with familiarity with the equipment (4.3, 4.4). The percentage is kept low as the report does not emphasize this as a major contributing factor.
- name: Crew Resource Management
  percentage: 15
  explanation: The lack of effective Crew Resource Management (CRM) was a significant safety issue. The staff did not perform challenge and confirm actions to complete fundamental brake test procedures (4.5, 5.6). The report emphasizes the importance of non-technical skills and CRM, which were not used to good effect, contributing to the accident.
- name: Adherence to Safety Procedures
  percentage: 20
  explanation: The accident was significantly influenced by the failure to adhere to safety procedures. The incomplete coupling connection went undetected, the brake handles were set incorrectly, and the intermediate brake test was not performed (4.1.4, 4.4, 4.5.9). These lapses in following established safety procedures were direct contributors to the accident.
- name: Organizational Safety Culture
  percentage: 10
  explanation: The report indicates that KiwiRail has taken steps to address safety culture, including the implementation of non-technical skills training and updates to its safety management systems (4.5.11-4.5.15). While the report does not directly blame organizational safety culture for the accident, the need for improvements suggests it was a contributing factor.
- name: Risk Management and Analysis
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not provide specific information that suggests risk management and analysis were directly at fault for the accident. Therefore, this theme is assigned a zero percentage.

    '
- name: Regulatory Oversight and Compliance
  percentage: 5
  explanation: While the report mentions improvements and compliance with regulations post-accident, it does not indicate that a lack of regulatory oversight was a direct cause of the accident (4.2.3, 4.5.16). The percentage is kept low as the report does not emphasize this as a major contributing factor.
- name: Situational Awareness
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Situational awareness issues were present, such as the failure to detect the incomplete electrical connection and the incorrect brake handle configuration (4.3, 4.4). However, the report does not highlight situational awareness as a primary cause, so the percentage is kept low.
- name: Emergency Response Preparedness
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not discuss emergency response preparedness as a contributing factor to the accident, so this theme is assigned a zero percentage.

    '
- name: Maintenance and Inspection Regimes
  percentage: 0
  explanation: The investigation did not uncover any mechanical faults with the wagons, locomotives, or track geometry issues that could have contributed to the derailment (4.1.5). Therefore, maintenance and inspection regimes are not considered contributing factors in this accident.
- name: Use of Automation
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'The report does not indicate that the use of automation was a factor in the accident, so this theme is assigned a zero percentage.

    '
- name: Weather Conditions and Decision Making
  percentage: 0
  explanation: 'Weather conditions are not mentioned as a factor in the accident, so this theme is assigned a zero percentage.

    '
- name: Communication Breakdown
  percentage: 5
  explanation: Communication breakdown contributed to the accident, as evidenced by the train examiner forgetting to pass on information about the locomotives not working together (4.5.6). However, the report does not suggest that communication breakdown was the primary cause, so the percentage is kept low.
- name: Other
  percentage: 0
  explanation: There is no indication in the report of other safety themes not already covered that contributed to the accident. Therefore, this theme is assigned a zero percentage.
