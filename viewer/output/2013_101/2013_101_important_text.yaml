  \  \n4.1.1.  Mainline derailments have the potential to cause serious harm to people\
  \ , and damage  to \nlocomotives , wagons, rail infrastructure  and the freight\
  \ being conveyed.   They therefore have \nsignificant implications for transport\
  \ safety.   This derailment occurred close to occupied farm \ndwellings , and the\
  \ extended recovery period disrupted production at the steel mill the Mission \n\
  Bush Branch line served.  \n4.1.2.  The actual derailm ent occurred after the train\
  \ had separated when , seconds later, the rear \nportion of 30 wagons ran into the\
  \ front six wagons and three locomotives.  Evidence showed \nthat t he front portion\
  \ of the train had slowed more quickly than the heavier rear portion of  the \n\
  train , very likely because of the heav y weight of the 30 wagons and the three\
  \ l ocomotives \nbeing already under braking . \n4.1.3.  The impact of the collision\
  \ forced three wagons to derail simultaneously .  Driver A had not \nbeen able to\
  \ apply the train's brakes, b ut the  retained air pressure in the wagons ' brake\
  \ \ncylinders resulted in t he wagon brakes automatically appl ying on both portions\
  \ of the train \nwhen the hoses separated  between the sixth and seventh wagons\
  \ . \n4.1.4.  The separation between the sixth and seventh wagon s and was very\
  \ likely caused by an \nincomplete coupling connection that had gone undetected\
  \ during the terminal brake test \nundertaken at Mission Bush before the train \
  \ depart ed.  The incomplete coupling allowed the \nhook  to spring up when the\
  \ coupling s suddenl y compressed as the train descend ed the \ngradient from Glenbrook\
  \ . \n4.1.5.  The investigation did not uncover any mechanical faults with the wagons\
  \ , any freight loading \nissues , or any track geometry iss ues that could have\
  \ contributed to the derailment.   None of \nthe three locomotives had any mechanical\
  \ faults that made it unserviceable , except for the \nunderlying brake handle issue\
  \ on the DL locomotives.  Subsequent tests carried out on t he \nsame three locomotives\
  \  showed that th e brakes on the wagons would not have functioned \nwith the identical\
  \ brake control configuration as set  when the train left Glenbrook . \n4.1.6. \
  \ The following analysis discusses the factors leading to the derailment , and safety\
  \ issues \nrelating to non -compliance with t rain operating practices.  \n4.2.\
  \ The train drivers' and train examiner's actions  \n4.2.1.  Both train drivers\
  \ and the train examiner were qualified  for the ir roles.  With the exception of\
  \ \ndriver B, they had recently demonstrated compliance with the intermediate brake\
  \ test \nprocedures.  \n4.2.2.  Driver B's most recent assessment for intermediate\
  \ brake tests had been undertaken in July \n1999.  He was therefore  12 years overdue\
  \ for his intermediate brake test assessment.  This, \ntogether with two other instances\
  \ where driver A and the trai n examiner were overdue for their \nbiannual theory\
  \ assessments , has since been addressed by KiwiRail.  \n4.2.3.  KiwiRail implemented\
  \ an improved assessment management system for  its staff members  \nduring July\
  \ 2014 .  The system now provides all levels of KiwiRail manag ement with a \ntransparent\
  \ overview of dates by which any  outstanding assessment s must be completed.  \n\
  4.2.4.  During the investigation the Commission identified the following procedural\
  \ lapses by the \nlocomotive servicing staff, the train drivers and the train examiner\
  \ : \n\uF0B7 the electrical connection was not fitted correctly by the servicing\
  \ staff prior to the two \nlocomotives leaving Auckland  and was not subsequently\
  \ identified or checked by driver A  \n\uF0B7 the incomplete coupling between the\
  \ sixth and seventh wagons was not detected during \nthe terminal brake test prior\
  \ to the train leaving M ission Bush  \n \nFinal Report RO -2013-101 \n<< Page 11\
  \ >>\n \uF0B7 the brake handles in the rear cab of the lead locomotive were left\
  \ in an incorrect \nconfiguration . \n4.2.5.  The Commission reviewed KiwiRail 's\
  \ procedures and instructions for these t asks  and \nidentified a number of improvements,\
  \ which KiwiRail subsequently made.  \n4.3. The incomplete electrical plug connection\
  \  \nSafety issue - The incomplete electrical plug  connection went undetected by\
  \ several rail staff.  \nIndependently, both locomotives were performing correctly\
  \ , but the incomplete  electrical  \nconnection meant they were not operating together\
  \ . \n4.3.1.  The incomplete electrical connection resulted in the two locomotives\
  \  only intermittently \noperating together .  It was this poor locomotive performance\
  \ that ultimately  led to the train \nbeing unnecessarily declared as disabled at\
  \ Glenbrook .  This was the first in a chain of events \nthat led to the derailment.\
  \  \n4.3.2.  Had driver A checked the electrical connection before leaving Mission\
  \ Bush , it could have \nbeen rect ified by simply pushing home the plug on the\
  \ second locomotive until the lug on the \ntop flap locked into the depression at\
  \ the top of the plug ( refer  Figure 3).  \n4.3.3.  There  is no automatic alert\
  \ to inform a train driver when  an electrical connection  is not fully  \nengaged.\
  \  Train drivers use their experience to monitor the performance of multiple \n\
  locomotives hauling trains . \n4.3.4.  The ammeters5 in the driving cab would have\
  \ shown driver A that driving amps  were being \ngenerated for the traction motors\
  \  within the normal operat ing range  for both locomotive s.  This \nwould have\
  \ been an indication to the train d river that both were fully functional and that\
  \ there \nwas potentially a problem with the electrical connection between the two\
  \ locomotives . \n4.3.5.  The servic ing staff and the train driver were qualified\
  \ for their roles and all had experience in \nfitting and checking electrical connections\
  \ bet ween locomotives .  KiwiRail reviewed its \nlocomotive servicing procedures\
  \ and used this derailment to highlight the need for train \ndrivers to include\
  \ visual examination s of electrical connection s when dealing with  any similar\
  \ \nlocomotive performance issues .  Consequently, t he Commission has not made\
  \ any \nrecommendations to KiwiRail to address this issue.  \n4.4. Incorrect brake\
  \ handle  set-up \nSafety issue - Driver B was able to set the brake handles incorrectly\
  \ because there was no \ninter lock6 capability between the two driving cabs of\
  \ the DL-class locomotive s.  The incorrect \nbrake set -up resulted in  driver\
  \ B not having brake control over the coupled wagons . \n4.4.1.  The DL-class  locomotive\
  \ was  the first double -cab diesel locomotive to operate in New Zealand \nthat\
  \ had brake handles permanently fitted to both cabs.   It required train drivers\
  \ to set the  \nlocomotive  and train brake handles correctly before vacating a\
  \ cab and relocating to the cab \nat the other end.  \n4.4.2.  In comparison , the\
  \ e arlier -generation double -cab diesel  and electric locomotives , and the \n\
  current fleet of double -cab EF -class electric locomotives , required some  or\
  \ all of the brake \nhandles  to be physically transferred by the drivers when changing\
  \ ends.   This meant that train \ndrivers had to isolate the brakes in a cab being\
  \ vacated in order to remove the appropriate \nhandles .  The handles were then\
  \ carried to the other cab , where th ey were inserted to allow \n             \
  \                                           \n5 An ammeter is a dial fitted on a\
  \ locomoti ve's dashboard to display the amount of current being produced by \n\
  the electrical generator.  \n6 A mechanical or electrical feature that ensures that\
  \ the operation of two linked mechanisms, brake handles \nin this instance, cannot\
  \ be independently operated at t he same time . \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final Repot\
  \ RO -2013 -101 the brakes  to be controlled from that end of the locomotive . \
  \ This manual process provided a  \nreliable  interlock , prevent ing an incorrect\
  \ brake handle set -up as seen in this instance . \n4.4.3.  KiwiRail investigated\
  \ several options before choosing the Tranzlog event recorder system to \nprovide\
  \ an interlock capability  to prevent a similar incident .  The Tranzlog system\
  \ was chosen \nto perform  this interlock b ecause the positions of the brake handles\
  \ were  already being \nmonitored by the system.  This option was successfully t\
  \ ested during 2014/2015 and rolled \nout on all the DL-class  locomotives.  In\
  \ view of this work, t he Commission has not made a \nrecommendation to KiwiRail\
  \ to address this issue.  \n4.4.4.  Additionally , KiwiRail has committed to provid\
  \ ing a similar Tranzlog -based interlock capability  \non all its other mainline\
  \ diesel locomotives .  This work will supplement the existing manual \ninterlock\
  \ and was underway at the time of the compilation of this report.  \nFinding s \n\
  1. The train departed Gl enbrook with only the locomotive brakes operating.  The\
  \ \nbrakes on all of the wagons (the train brake) were not working because the driver\
  \ \nhad omitted to configure the brake levers correctly when changing from one \n\
  driving cab to the other.  \n2. The driver was ab le to depart with a wrongly configured\
  \ brake system because \nthere was no mechanical interlock to prevent his doing\
  \ so.  \n3. The required pre -departure train brake test would have revealed that\
  \ the train \nbrake was not operational, but those involved omitted to p erform\
  \ the test when a \nthird locomotive was attached to the train.  \n4. The train\
  \ parted when a coupling that had not been fully secured allowed the \nhook to spring\
  \ up when the couplings suddenly compressed as the train \ndescended the gradient\
  \ from Glenbrook . \n5. The derailment was caused by the rear portion of the train\
  \ colliding with the \nforward portion seconds after the train parted.  \n4.5. Non-technical\
  \ skills  \nSafety issue  - When the three staff members came together to couple\
  \ the third  locomotive to \nthe disabled train at Glenbrook, no challenge and confirm\
  \ action s were taken to complete a \nfundamental brake test procedure , which was\
  \ designed to ensure  that the trains ' air brakes \nwere functioning correctly.\
  \  \n4.5.1.  Non-technical skills (previously known as crew resource managemen t)\
  \ are a set of practices \ndesigned to create a safe working environment, encourage\
  \ teamwork, improve situational \nawareness and understand technical proficiency\
  \ . \n4.5.2.  Staff using non-technical skills will communicate more effectively\
  \ , be more aware of their \nsituation, use all of its available resources  and\
  \ work better with one another.   Communication \nskills and practices form a significant\
  \ component of what has become known as non -technical \nskills in other transport\
  \ modes.  \n4.5.3.  The issue of non -technical skills was raised in seven rail\
  \ occurrence reports published by the \nCommission between 2003 and 2008.  Recommendations\
  \ were made to KiwiRail to establish \nnon-technical skills as a core operating\
  \ practice to help reduce accidents and incidents within \nthe rail industry . \n\
  \  \n \nFinal Report RO -2013-101 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.5.4.  The Commission had issued\
  \ its most recent recommendation on non -technical skills to the NZ \nTransport\
  \ Agency during 2012.  The recommendation required  that the practice of non -\n\
  technical skills be recognised in the National Rail System Standard s.  The re commendation\
  \ \nremained open at the time of compiling this report.  \n4.5.5.  In this instance,\
  \ t he non -technical skill lapses were  that: \n\uF0B7 the comments by mill shunting\
  \ staff regarding the two locomotives not working \ntogether were not communicated\
  \  \n\uF0B7 the required intermedi ate brake test was not carried out when the third\
  \ locomotive \nwas attached to the train at Glenbrook.  \n4.5.6.  The train examiner\
  \ forgot to pass on the information to the train driver after the mill shunting\
  \ \nstaff had identified that the locomotives did not seem to be working together.\
  \  The mill \nshunting staff were alert to the problem , and had the train examiner\
  \ informed driver A of what \nhe had been told, the driver  may have been prompted\
  \ to examine the electrical connection \nand could have  found  that it was not\
  \ properly connected.  \n4.5.7.  If driver A had corrected the electrical connection,\
  \ the train would have had sufficient \nlocomotive power without the addition of\
  \ the third locomotive . \n4.5.8.  KiwiRail's air brake rules stated that an intermediate\
  \ brake test was required when a \nlocomotive was added to a train.  The straightforward\
  \  test involved t he train examiner \nposition ing himself alongside any wagon\
  \  on the train to observe the movement of the piston in \nthe brake cylinder when\
  \ driver B applied and released the train 's brakes  from the lead \nlocomotive\
  \ . \n4.5.9.  In this case the train examiner would have observed that the wagon's\
  \  brake s were  not \nworking .  This would have prompted driver B to re -examine\
  \ his brake handle set -up.  The train \nwould not then have departed with a non-operational\
  \  train brake.   Although driver B was \nresponsible for ensuring compliance with\
  \ this task, either driver A or the train examiner should \nhave advised driver\
  \ B that the intermediate test was required.  \n4.5.10.  As a result,  there w as\
  \ no braking control on the loaded wag ons that weighed a total of 1,845 \ntonne\
  \ s.  Driver B was unable to reduce  the speed of the train  and comply with the\
  \ 40 km/h \nrestriction  shortly  after leaving the level crossing at Glenbrook.\
  \  \n4.5.11.  On 26 October 2016 KiwiRail provided the Commission with an updat\
  \ ed implementation plan  \nto develop non-technical skills within its workforce.\
  \  The plan stated that non -technical skills \nmust be embedded and promoted in\
  \ the workforce in order to build a strong safety culture.   \nThe plan showed that\
  \ b etween 2014 and 2016 the following  number of KiwiRail staff had \nparticipated\
  \ in training programmes that included the principles of non-technical -skills :\
  \ \n2014  2015  2016  2017 \n(proposed)  \n337 502 638 625 \n4.5.12.  On 14 December\
  \ 2016 KiwiRail provided the Commission with a further update on its plan ned \n\
  implementation of its non-technical skills policy in the management of its core\
  \ business \noperations and practices.  KiwiRail said that current thinking internationally\
  \ on the \nmanagement of non -technical skills with in rail and other modal transport\
  \ industries has \nshifted.  The new  policy  requires non -technical skills princip\
  \ les to be embedded in all technical \nand non -technical training, safety assessments/observations/aud\
  \ its and assurance activities \nwithin an organisation 's safety management and\
  \ crew management systems.  \n4.5.13.  KiwiRail has referred to extensive material\
  \ produced by the Rail Safety and Standards Board  \nLimited and Network Rail in\
  \ the United Kingdom.  KiwiRail said that this approach was  a big \nstep forward\
  \  because it had to have organisational alignment across all of its business groups\
  \ \nand not be restricted to above rail , as was the case when non-technical skills\
  \ practices were \nfirst delivered during the mid -1990s.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final\
  \ Repot RO -2013 -101 4.5.14.  KiwiRail said that o ther work done in the risk management\
  \ of SPADs (signals passed at \ndanger) had seen the development and implementation\
  \ of a  stabilised approach, risk- \ntriggered commentary driving and engineering\
  \ supervisory controls within its safety \nmanagement systems .  These actions were\
  \  designed to support train driver cognition, trap \nhuman error before an accident\
  \ and enable recovery to a safe condition.  \n4.5.15.  These plans show that KiwiRail\
  \ is continuing  to address non -technical skills awareness and \ntherefore the\
  \ Commission will not be making a further recommendation on this matter.  \nMeanwhile,\
  \ t he Commission 's recommendation  002/12 made  to the NZ Transport Agency in\
  \ \n2012  remains open . \n4.5.16.  On 3 April 2017 the  NZ Transport Agency said\
  \ that it was continuing to work with KiwiRail on \nthis issue.  The agency added\
  \ that it had issued a safety improvement plan notice during \nDecember 2016 in\
  \ accordance with section 36 of the Railways Act 2005 , requiring KiwiRail to \n\
  prepare a safety improvement plan to address the implementation of non -technical\
  \ skills in its \nrail operations.  \nFinding  \n6. There were several opportunities\
  \ to break the chain of events leading to the \nderailment.  However, non -technical\
  \ skills (otherwise known as crew resource \nmanagement) were not being used to\
  \ good effect.  \n4.6. The train drivers ' and train examiner 's performance  \n\
  Safety issue - There were several  procedural lapses by three experienced rail staff\
  \ members  \nbetween the coupling of the two locomotives at Auckland and the train\
  \ examiner 's \ndismounting from the train 12 hours later . \n4.6.1.  The Commission\
  \ has considered whether  fatigue w as a contributory factor  in respect of both\
  \ \ndrivers and the train examiner not carry ing out the intermediate brake test.\
  \  \n4.6.2.  Driver A was working his second day after a period of leave and the\
  \ train examiner had been \noff duty for the preceding weekend.  They had started\
  \ work the previous evening at 1630 and \n1745 respectively and said they had been\
  \ feeling tired when it came to coupling the third \nlocomotive to the train at\
  \ Glenbrook.  \n4.6.3.  However, based on driver A 's and the train examiner 's\
  \ hours of work and their comments, it \nwas very unlikely that either of these\
  \ two member s was suffering from fatigue.  \n4.6.4.  On the other hand, driver\
  \ B reported suffering restless sl eep during the three days leading up \nto the\
  \ derailment.  Although he reported feeling well when he started work at midnight\
  \  on 8 \nJanuary 2013, he overlooked the setting of the brake handles  only four\
  \ and a half hours later . \n4.6.5.  Driver B s aid that he had not rested well\
  \ and his sleep had been light and restless.  It was \nhighly likely that he was\
  \ suffering from a level of sleep iness  and was tired before starting the \nnight\
  \ shift .  It was unlikely t hat he had reached a level of fatigue  based on his\
  \ hours of work \nleading up to the derailment and from his comments . \n4.6.6.\
  \  The procedural lapses occurred during the period when circadian rhythm is at\
  \ its lowest7.  Not \nchecking the correct setting of the brake ha ndles and not\
  \ calling for an intermediate brake \ntest occurred at precisely 0430, the time\
  \ when  cognitive performance  is typically at its lowest . \n  \n             \
  \                                           \n7 The time in the natural body clock\
  \ when performance is at its lowest and the drive for sleep is at its highest. \
  \ \n \nFinal Report RO -2013-101 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.6.7.  Research by sleep/wake\
  \ experts8 has show n that t he period between 0300 and 0500, and \nspecifically\
  \ 0430, is when a person's body reaches its lowest temperature , which in turn leads\
  \ \nto reduced cognitive performance.  Recognising that  two procedural lapses occurred\
  \ during \nthis critical period, it may help to explain some of the shortcomings,\
  \ particularly the need for \ndriver B to call for an intermediate brake test .\
  \ \n4.6.8.  The Commission published six rail occurrence reports into freight train\
  \ derailments and \ncollisions during a two-year period between September 2000 and\
  \ July 2002.  Two of the \nthemes identified in the repo rts were:  \n\uF0B7 train\
  \ driver roster management  \n\uF0B7 recognising the difficulties of train drivers\
  \ attaining good -quality sleep during summer \nmonths.  \nThe Commission published\
  \ , and repeated , four recommendations in those six reports to Tranz \nRail (the\
  \ penultimate prede cessor to KiwiRail) to address these issues.  The four \nrecommendations\
  \ were subsequently closed out after the Sleep /Wake Research Centre in \nWellington\
  \ developed a best -practice policy for rostering train drivers.  \n4.6.9.  On 1\
  \ December 2013 KiwiRail and the Rail an d Maritime Transport Union issued a document\
  \ \ntitled 'Summer SPAD Awareness '.  The document identified that the summer months\
  \ \n(December -February) were among the worst for SPADs and other safety -related\
  \ incidents.  \n4.6.10.  The purpose of the document was to raise awareness of the\
  \ increased risks brought on during \nthe summer months and offer advice to staff\
  \ members on how to reduce the likelihood of \nincidents.  One topic addressed was\
  \ fatigue and shift work.  The document identified that \nfatigue was exaggerated\
  \ by the longer daylight hours and hotter temperatures reduc ing the \nability for\
  \ shift  workers  to obtain adequate rest , and the ability to get good sleep during\
  \ the \nday. \n4.6.11.  Between October and December 2016, KiwiRail engaged with\
  \ its train  operating staff and \nprovided an update to its summertime fatigue\
  \ management program me, address ing the \nincreased risk of incidents occurring\
  \ during this period.  The programme covered matters such \nas entering shifts prepared,\
  \ situational awar eness and the 'stop, think, act, review' process.  \nBased on\
  \ the evidence supplied , the Commission has not made any further recommendations\
  \ . \nFinding  \n7. It is likely that the time of day, when  cognitive performance\
  \ is at its lowest due to \nnatural circadian rhyt hm, and the length of time on\
  \ shift were factors affecting the \nperformance of those involved in setting up\
  \ and checking the train.  However, \nthere was no evidence that fatigue due to\
  \ accumulated sleep loss was a factor . \n                                     \
