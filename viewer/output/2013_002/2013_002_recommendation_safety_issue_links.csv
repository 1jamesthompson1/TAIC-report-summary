2013_002,025/14,the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he promote the use of quick-donning life jackets for all occupants of single-engine aircraft flying over water.,"Civil Aviation Rule 91.525 requires a life jacket to be available for each person on board a single-engine aircraft being flown beyond the gliding distance from shore. The life jacket is to be stowed in a readily accessible position. The Commission has previously recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that on all flights, if at any point a ditching is likely to have a better outcome than a forced landing on unfavourable terrain, life jackets should be carried. Helicopters descend at a much higher rate in autorotation than an aeroplane does when gliding. Therefore, even if life jackets are carried, helicopter passengers are likely to be faced with minimal time to find and fit their life jackets if faced with a ditching.

On 10 December 2014 ","The imported second-hand engine and its accessories had not been subjected to the inspections and maintenance required for continued airworthiness before they were released to service.

On 10 December 2014 ","The risk to people involved in helicopter operations over water will be reduced if quick-donning life jackets are worn at all times where there is the potential for the helicopter to ditch with short notice.

2013_002,026/14,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he provide specific guidance to Civil Aviation Rule Part 145 certified companies, for the performance of conformity inspections of parts and components with unknown service histories or incomplete airworthiness documentation, or that have been stored improperly.","An engine that had been involved in a sudden stoppage incident overseas was put through a conformity inspection and released to service in New Zealand without the required inspections having been completed. The regulator's guidelines for inspecting used parts of unknown origin was not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were not adequate in this case. A thorough research of the engine's history, seeking further details of the accident and clarification from the vendor, would have likely uncovered the sudden stoppage event, and the required inspections would have been carried out.
