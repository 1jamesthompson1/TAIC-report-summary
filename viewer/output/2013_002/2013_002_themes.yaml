- name: Maintenance Procedures and Oversight
  explanation: Maintenance procedures and oversight are critical for ensuring the airworthiness of aircraft components. In this accident, a simple maintenance error was identified as the most likely cause of the engine power loss. Specifically, "an oil slinger was omitted during a maintenance procedure" (5.1), which led to engine oil accumulating in the magneto. This oversight in maintenance procedures compromised the magneto's function, directly contributing to the incident. Additionally, the engine and its accessories had not been subjected to the inspections and maintenance required for continued airworthiness before being released to service (5.2), highlighting the importance of thorough maintenance and adherence to established procedures.
- name: Inspection of Used Parts
  explanation: The inspection of used parts, especially those of unknown origin, is a safety theme that is relevant to this accident. The engine involved in the incident was second-hand and lacked proper documentation to reflect its airworthiness status (4.3.1). The guidelines for inspecting such parts were not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were inadequate (5.3). This resulted in the engine being released to service without the necessary inspections and maintenance, which could have identified the omission of the oil slinger and prevented the power loss.
- name: Compliance with Mandatory Service Bulletins
  explanation: Compliance with mandatory service bulletins is a safety theme that ensures aircraft components are maintained according to the latest safety standards and manufacturer recommendations. In this case, the engine's logbook did not record the manufacturer's mandatory service bulletins as having been carried out, nor were they completed by Aeromotive before the engine was released to service (4.3.9). This lack of compliance with mandatory service bulletins could have led to undetected issues with the engine components, such as the magnetos, which were found to have cracked distributor blocks after the incident (4.2.4).
- name: Engine Accessory Inspection and Testing
  explanation: The inspection and testing of engine accessories are crucial for identifying potential issues that could lead to engine failure. The engine and its accessories were not functionally checked during the conformity inspection, or prior to the issue of the Form One (4.3.7). This oversight meant that the malfunctioning right magneto, which was likely the cause of the engine power loss, was not identified and rectified before the engine was put into service.
- name: Training and Guidance for Conformity Inspections
  explanation: Training and guidance for carrying out conformity inspections of aircraft parts are essential for ensuring that maintenance personnel are adequately equipped to assess the airworthiness of components. The CAA had not released training material specifically for engineers who carried out this type of conformity inspection, and it was left up to the Part 145 companies to train their staff in the procedures involved (4.3.14). The procedures used during the conformity inspection in this case did not ensure that the engine was acceptable for installation, suggesting a need for improved guidance and training (4.3.14).
- name: Life Jacket Usage in Over-Water Operations
  explanation: The use of life jackets in over-water operations is a safety theme that can significantly reduce the risk to occupants in the event of a ditching. Although the operator had complied with the regulatory requirement for the carriage of life jackets, the occupants were not required to wear them under normal circumstances (4.4.1). The incident highlights the importance of not only carrying but also wearing quick-donning life jackets, especially in single-engine helicopter operations where a ditching could occur with little notice (4.4.4).
