- name: Maintenance Procedures and Oversight
  explanation: Maintenance procedures and oversight are critical for ensuring the airworthiness of aircraft components. In this accident, the omission of an oil slinger during the reassembly of the right magneto was a direct cause of the engine power loss. The report states, "it is highly likely that the omission of the oil slinger when reassembling the right magneto contributed to the engine loss of power" (4.2.9). Additionally, the report highlights that the imported second-hand engine and its accessories "had not been subjected to the inspections and maintenance required for continued airworthiness before they were released to service" (5.2). This theme is relevant because proper maintenance procedures could have prevented the accumulation of oil in the magneto, which was the most likely cause of the engine power loss.
- name: Inspection of Used Aircraft Parts
  explanation: The inspection of used aircraft parts is a safety theme that ensures parts are airworthy and suitable for use. The report indicates that the engine's history and the lack of appropriate accompanying documentation meant it should have been subjected to more rigorous inspections (4.3.9). The failure to perform mandatory service bulletins and the lack of adherence to CAA guidance for inspecting used parts of unknown origin (4.3.15) are also highlighted. This theme is relevant to the accident because the engine, sourced from overseas, was not properly inspected or documented, which could have contributed to the oversight in maintenance that led to the engine power loss.
- name: Regulatory Guidelines and Compliance
  explanation: Regulatory guidelines and compliance are essential for maintaining safety standards in aviation. The report points out that the regulator's guidelines for inspecting used parts of unknown origin were not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were not adequate (5.3). Furthermore, the report notes that the standards of maintenance and inspection for the import and eventual release to service of the helicopter engine did not meet the standards of aviation maintenance best practice (4.3.9). This theme is relevant because the lack of clear guidelines and non-compliance with existing regulations contributed to the improper inspection and maintenance of the engine, leading to the accident.
- name: Engine and Accessory Serviceability
  explanation: Engine and accessory serviceability is a theme that focuses on the proper functioning of all engine components and accessories. The report discusses the cracked distributor blocks in both magnetos and the substantial amount of engine lubricating oil found inside the breaker compartment of the right magneto (4.2.3, 4.2.5). These issues directly affected the timing and strength of the ignition spark, leading to a decrease in engine performance and ultimately the loss of engine power (4.2.7). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of ensuring that all engine components are in good condition and function correctly to prevent power loss incidents.
- name: Training and Expertise in Maintenance
  explanation: Training and expertise in maintenance are crucial for the proper handling and servicing of aircraft components. The report reveals that the CAA had not released training material specifically for engineers who carried out conformity inspections, and it was left up to Part 145 companies to train their staff in the procedures involved (4.3.14). The lack of specific training may have contributed to the oversight during the maintenance procedure that led to the engine power loss. This theme is relevant because adequate training and expertise are necessary to ensure that maintenance personnel can correctly identify and rectify potential issues during inspections and servicing.
- name: Life Jacket Usage and Safety Equipment
  explanation: Life jacket usage and safety equipment are important themes in aviation safety, particularly for flights over water. The report discusses the benefits of aircraft occupants wearing life jackets on flights over water, although it was not a factor in this incident (4.1.3). It also recommends that the risk to people involved in helicopter operations over water will be reduced if quick-donning life jackets are worn at all times where there is the potential for the helicopter to ditch with short notice (4.4.4, 5.4). This theme is relevant as it addresses the preparedness for emergency situations, such as ditching, and the importance of having and using appropriate safety equipment to reduce the risk of injury or fatality.
