  \  \n4.1.1.  The Commission found no operational factors that contributed to the\
  \ incident.  The pilot, \nalthough not experienced, was appropriately qualified\
  \ and licen sed to fly the helicopter on \npassenger operations.  The evidence show\
  \ ed that it was highly likely that the helicopter \nexperienced an in -flight loss\
  \ of engine power.  The pilot responded appropriately to the \nhelicopter losing\
  \ power, and made the best of a potentially serious situation b y immediately \n\
  entering the helicopter into autorotation and flying it towards the shallow waters\
  \ near the lake \nedge.  \n4.1.2.  The following analysis discusses the likely \
  \ cause  of the loss of engine power .  It also discusses \na safety issue regarding\
  \ the standard s of inspection and maintenance of the helicopter 's \nengine  before\
  \ it was released to service.  \n4.1.3.  The benefit s of aircraft occupants  wearing\
  \ life jackets  on flights over water, alth ough not a \nfactor in this incident\
  \ , are also discussed.  \n4.2. Potential  causes of the loss of  engine power \
  \ \n4.2.1.  The passengers recalled a strong smell of fuel at the time of the loss\
  \ of power , and witnesses \non the ground  recalled hearing \"banging noises\"\
  \ from the helicopter.  A strong smell of fuel is \none indication that an engine\
  \ is not burning  all of the fuel inside the cylinders.  In such a case , \nunburnt\
  \ fuel can be  ignited in the hot exhaust manifold after leaving the engine cylinders\
  \ , or \nbe distributed into the airflow around the helicopter . \n4.2.2.  Fuel\
  \ igni ting in the exhaust manifold  can cause backfiring13, which was probably\
  \ the loud \nbanging described by witnesses .  Another  common cause of  backfiring\
  \ in an engine  is a \nproblem with the ignition system, such as a weak spark or\
  \ incorrect timing  of the spark . The \nengine magnetos are an essent ial component\
  \ for providing a spark  for combustion  at the right \ntime. If the  timing of\
  \ the spark is delayed  (retarded) , backfiring and associated power loss can \n\
  also occur.  \nMagnetos  \n4.2.3.  The magnetos are a self -contained engine component,\
  \ consisting of a rotating permanent \nmagnet, field coils and breaker points, which\
  \  generates the spark at a set time across the \nengine spark plugs that initiates\
  \ the combustion of the fuel/air mixture.  Both the left and right  \nmagneto s\
  \ suppl y a spark to every cylinder , for redundancy and efficiency .  This  means\
  \  that if \none magneto is defective, the engine should still run  with a reduced\
  \ power output .  When the \nmagnetos were inspected after the incident, b oth the\
  \ left and right magneto distributor blocks \nwere found to be cracked.  Also ,\
  \ a substantial amount of engine lubricating oil was found \ninside the breaker\
  \ compartment of the right magneto.  \n4.2.4.  A cracked distributer block can affect\
  \ both the timing and stre ngth of the engine ignition \nspark, although to what\
  \ extent is difficult to determine.  Distributor blocks are normally reliable \n\
  and durable .  It would be highly unusual for the blocks in both magnetos to develop\
  \ cracks \nunder normal conditions.  F or both to  develop cracks  at the same time\
  \ indicates that both \nwere subjected to some form of  external stress .  A sudden\
  \ stoppage event14 and damage \nduring maintenance and installation are possible\
  \ causes .  The power loss incident at Lake \nRotorua was not considered t o be\
  \ a sudden stoppage event, as the main rotors did not strike \nthe water.  \n4.2.5.\
  \  The oil found in the breaker compartment on the right magneto wa s more significan\
  \ t.  During \nthe conformity inspection Aeromotive had inspected both magnetos\
  \ in accordance with the \nmanufacturer's 500 -hour inspection schedule .  That\
  \  involved disassembly of the magnetos.  \n                                   \
  \                     \n13 Backfir ing in the exhaust manifold is also referred\
  \ to as \"afterfire\".  \n14 When a rotating main rotor blade or propeller that\
  \ is connected to an engine strikes a solid object such as \nground or another aircraft\
  \ . \n \nFinal report AO -2013 -002 \n<< Page 9 >>\n When the right magneto was\
  \ reassembled an oil slinger was not refitted to the internal drive \nshaft that\
  \ connected the engine -driven accessory gearbox to the magneto.  Therefore o il\
  \ was \nable t o move from the engine -driven  accessory gearbox through the magneto\
  \ and accumulate \ninside  the breaker compartment, which housed the electrical\
  \ control components of the \nmagneto.  \n4.2.6.  The level of the oil in the breaker\
  \ compartment would  have risen  while the engine was \nrunning .  Eventually the\
  \ oil level w ould have  reach ed the breaker points inside the normally \ndry compartment\
  \ .  Engine o il does not conduct electricity , therefore the functioning of the\
  \ \ncontact breaker points that opened and  closed , controlling the ignition spark\
  \ , would have \nbeen affected .  This would have altered the timing and strength\
  \ of the ignition spark produced \nat the associated spark plugs, or preve nted\
  \ a spark being made at all.  \n4.2.7.  It is highly likely that the timing an d\
  \ strength of the ignition spark produced by at least six out \nof the  engine's\
  \ 1215 spark plugs would have been affected by the amount of oil in the right \n\
  magneto. This  would have  likely  led to a decrease in engine performance . \n\
  4.2.8.  A second set of breaker points inside the right magneto sends a pulse signal\
  \ to the engine \nRPM governor, which is designed to keep the engine RPM within\
  \ a certain range.  It could have \nalso been affected by the oil in the breaker\
  \ compartment, which may hav e caused the \ngovernor to change the fuel flo w to\
  \ the engine due to a false RPM signal from the tachometer \nbreaker points.  The\
  \ governor could have been overridden by the pilot  opening the throttle , but \n\
  if she had not done that or that action had not restor ed power, an autoro tation\
  \ and ditching  \nwould have been  inevitable.  Governor failure  was less likely\
  \ to have caused a sustained  loss \nof power , but it could not be completely ruled\
  \ out as a potential cause of the initial power loss . \n4.2.9.  When considering\
  \ the amo unt of oil found in the right magneto after the incident and the \neffect\
  \ this would have  had on the magneto's performance, it is highly likely that the\
  \ omission \nof the oil slinger when reassembling  the right magneto  contributed\
  \  to the engine loss of \npower.  However, other possibilities were considered\
  \  and are discussed below.  \nEngine -driven fuel pump  \n4.2.10.  During post\
  \ -accident testing at Aeromotive, the engine -driven fuel pump was found to have\
  \ a \nlower -than -normal output pressure.  Although t he output pressure was above\
  \ the lowest \nallowable limit, Aeromotive discarded the pump  and did not  return\
  \  it to the operator.  The \nengine -driven fuel pump that was fitted to the engine\
  \  had been  subject to a n earlier  \nmandatory service bulletin issued by the\
  \ manufacturer , Lycoming , in 2005.   Certain pumps \nmade during a short period\
  \ in 2001 had been  found to have been manufactured outside the \nspecifications,\
  \ which  could result in a restricted fuel flow.   No record of the service bulletin\
  \ \nhaving been carried out on the pump  could be found in either the overseas logbooks\
  \ or the \nrecords for the conformity inspection  conducted by Aeromotive .  The\
  \ date of manufacture of \nthe pump was marked as a date code on the pump itself,\
  \ but, because the pump was \ndisposed of , the Commission was unable to determine\
  \ whether it had been  one of the \npotentially defective units.  \n4.2.11.  The\
  \ Commission contacted Lycoming to try to establish through its records  whether\
  \ the pump \ninstalled on the engine at engine manufacture had been  affected by\
  \ the service bulletin, as it \nwas the same pump fitted at the time of the incident.\
  \  However , Lycoming  said that it had not \nrecord ed the date the pump was made\
  \ or the engine  on which  it had been installed.  \n4.2.12.  Given that the fuel\
  \ pump was found to be still delivering fuel pressure above the minimum \nallowable\
  \ limit, it is unlikely that it would have caused the loss of engine power.  Nevertheless,\
  \ \nit is concerning that there was no record of Lycoming's mandatory s ervice bulletin\
  \ ever having \nbeen carried out.  This is discussed further in the following sections\
  \ of this report.  \n  \n                                                      \
  \  \n15 The engine had six cylinders and each cylinder had t wo spark plugs, one\
  \ plug supplied by the left magneto \nand the other by the right magneto.  \n \n\
  \n<< Page 10 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -002 Fuel control unit  \n4.2.13.  There\
  \ was no record of the fuel control unit having been disassembled,  inspected or\
  \ tested \nduring the conformity inspecti on.  H owever , it was  checked as being\
  \ the correct type for the \nengine model.  The engine and its components were released\
  \ to service and subsequently \nfitted to the helicopter .  After initial ground\
  \ runs  of the engine , the fuel control unit was sent \nback to  Aeromotive due\
  \ to rough running and an unsatisfactory flight check.  The unit was \nchecked and\
  \ adjusted to within speci fications.  At that time Aeromotive carried out a  CAA\
  \ \nairworthiness directive16 (DCA/MA/16 ) on the fuel control unit.   The directive\
  \ shoul d have \nbeen carried out as part of the conformity inspection , before\
  \ the fuel control unit was first \nrelease d to service .  The fuel control unit\
  \ was then refitted to the helicopter  and no further \nproblems were recorded with\
  \ the engine until the  power loss event.  During flow testing a fter \nthe incident,\
  \ the fuel control unit was found to be marginally \"lean\" at two test points .\
  \  It was \nthen disassembled  and adjusted,  and the stem seal and adjustment nut\
  \ were replaced inside \nthe servo chamber.  \n4.2.14.  It is not likely that the\
  \ fuel control unit contributed to the loss of power .  It had been operating \n\
  satisfactorily up until the incident, and the post -incident testing did not reveal\
  \ any significant \ndefects.  However, as with the engine -driven fuel pump, it\
  \ i s of concern that a CAA \nairworthiness directive had not been carried out on\
  \ the unit during the conformity inspection \nprior to the e ngine being released\
  \ to servic e. \n4.2.15.  In July 2014 the CAA issued an Airw orthiness Directive17\
  \ for fuel control unit s installed on  R44 \nII helicopters. It was prompted by\
  \ an incident in February 2014 involving an R44 II that lost \nengine power and\
  \ had to carry out an autorotation landing.  The directive  required all units to\
  \ \nbe disassembled and inspected within five hours ' flying time or 200 hours '\
  \ total time  in \nservice  (whichever was the later), to check for delamination\
  \ of a Teflon washer inside t he unit.  \nSeveral units, including the one involved\
  \ in the incident in February 2014, had badly \ndelaminated washers that had led\
  \ to material  separating from the washer s, and one had \npartially block ed the\
  \ fuel metering system at a fuel injection nozzle.   The fuel control unit \ninstalled\
  \ on the helicopter  at the time of the loss of engine power had been exchanged\
  \ for a \nnew unit when the engine wa s overhauled in November 201318.  Although\
  \ the unit could not \nbe traced by the manufacturer, the fuel metering system w\
  \ as checked for blockages during \nthe post -incident inspection .  All of t he\
  \ fuel nozzles were removed for inspection and their flow \nrates we re checked\
  \ in accordance with the engine manufacturer 's instructions.  No defects or \n\
  obstructions were found and the flow rates were equal and within the specified \
  \ limits. A \nblockage in the fuel metering system was very  unlikely to have been\
  \ the cause  of the loss of \nengine power.  \n4.3. Inspection and maintenance \
  \ \n4.3.1.  There is a degree of risk when second -hand engines and engine parts\
  \  are purchased , \nparticularly when the parts are sourced from overseas, outside\
  \ the New Zealand civil aviation \nsystem.  The CAA ha s issued guidance in the\
  \ form of Advisory Circular AC 00 -1 for owners and \noperators who purchase used\
  \ parts from overseas.   The advisory circular  stresses the \nimportance of sourcing\
  \ used parts from reputable organisations and ensur ing that  proper and \ncomple\
  \ te paperwork is provided to confirm the parts ' airworthiness status.  It also\
  \ warns that \nsalvaged parts may be passed off as serviceable and that there should\
  \ be  susp icion of any \nparts that do not have the  correct documentation . \n\
  4.3.2.  In this case t he engine that was fitted to the helicopter had  been  offered\
  \ for sale by Euram, a \nused aircraft parts dealer based in Austria .  There was\
  \ no accompanying documentation to \nreflect its airworthiness status.  There were\
  \ two documents supplied by the dealer together  \nwith t he original logbook .\
  \  The logbook  covered the entire  period of the  service history  of the \nengine\
  \ .  One of the documents was a removal certificate, which stated that the engine\
  \ had \n                                                        \n16 A mandatory\
  \ airworthiness requirement that specifies modifications, inspections, conditions\
  \ or limitations \nto be applied to an aircraft or aeronautical product to ensure\
  \ continued safe operating conditions . \n17 DCA/MA/17, 11 July 2014.  \n18 When\
  \ the operator was  made aware of the engine's sudden stoppage event of 2011, it\
  \ had the engine \noverhauled and the fuel control unit replaced.  \n \nFinal report\
  \ AO -2013 -002 \n<< Page 11 >>\n been removed from a n R44  helicopter and had\
  \ not been exposed to fire, water or extreme \nstress.  A second document was a\
  \ material certification that recorded the engine part and \nserial number, as well\
  \ as  the helicopter from which it had been  removed.  The second \ndocument stated\
  \ that the engine had not been subjected to fire or water.  I t did not mention\
  \ \nwhether it had been exposed to extreme stress.  Neither document was dated,\
  \ nor was there a \ndocument number or purchase order number recorded.  The sale\
  \ documents  did not include a  \n\"remov ed unservic eable\" tag or any other informa\
  \ tion about why the engine had been \nremoved .  Similarly, no such information\
  \ had been recorded in the engine logbook.  \n4.3.3.  The company that carried out\
  \ the conformity inspection (Aeromotive ) had been  made aware of \nthe engine 's\
  \ involvement  in an accident overseas.  The purchaser (Volcanic Air Safaris) told\
  \ \nAeromotive that the engine had not been  running  at the time  of the accident\
  \ .  Volcanic Air \nSafaris  had been  given this information  by the parts  dealer,\
  \ who  indicated that the helicopter \nin which  the engine  had been installed\
  \ had been  parked on the ground when it was struck by \nanother helicopter attempting\
  \ to land nearby.  Neither the operator nor Aeromotive  made \nenquiries to confirm\
  \ the details of the accident with the previous owner, nor  did they question \n\
  the lack of information  about the accident  in the engine's logbook and accompanying\
  \ \ndocuments . \n4.3.4.  After a n online  search of an international accident\
  \ database, the Commission found the full \ndetails of the accident  as well as\
  \  the publicly av ailable report into the accident completed by \nthe Swedish Accident\
  \ Investigation Authority.   It was clear from the  factual information in the \
  \ \naccident report that the engine had come from the helicopter that was attempting\
  \ to land, and \nthat the engine had been  running and therefore  subjected to a\
  \ sudden stoppage event.  \n4.3.5.  The manufacturer 's maintenance instructions\
  \  directed that following a sudden stoppage  the \nengine was to be disassembled,\
  \ paint -stripped and closely examined for damage using non-\ndestructive  testing\
  \ methods.  The engine accessories , including the magnetos , were required \nto\
  \ be examined for damage .  There was no evidence that this procedure had been \
  \ carried out  \neither before or after  the engine was removed from the helicopter\
  \ and listed for sal e.  \nAeromotive was not given, and did not seek, detailed\
  \  informati on about the accident in \nSweden.  Consequently  the procedure was\
  \ not carried out by Aeromotive in New Zealand \nbefore the engine was released\
  \ to service.  \n4.3.6.  Engines that are not used for periods  of more than 30\
  \ days are prone to component \ndeterioration, caused in part by the accumulation\
  \ of moisture within the engine.  In such cases \nthe engine manufacturer recommends\
  \ that an engine  be preserved or inhibited to protect it \nand its associate d\
  \ compon ents from deterioration .  No records could be found to confirm \nwhether\
  \ the engine had been  inhibited in the 18 months  that it was stored before being\
  \ sold \nto the operator .  This process normally involves draining  the normal\
  \ operating oil from the \nengine, filling it with special preserving oil, installing\
  \ moisture -absorbing desiccants and \nsealing the engine from the environment.\
  \  If this is not done prior to long -term storage, \ncorrosion can develop on exposed\
  \ parts, an d seals and diaphragms in the oil and fuel systems \ncan deteriorate\
  \ over time.   \n4.3.7.  As part of the conformity inspection the logbooks and original\
  \ export certificate of \nairworthiness issued in the United States were reviewed\
  \ to confirm the engine 's origin and \nservice history. The engine was also partially\
  \ disassembled to access the inside of the \ncrankcase, and various parts and components\
  \ were evaluated against the manufacturers ' \napproved type design data.  The engine\
  \ and its accessories were not functionally ch ecked \nduring the conformity inspection,\
  \ or prior to the issue of the Form One.  \n4.3.8.  The Commission checked the service\
  \ history of the engine against the CAA airworthiness \nrequirements and the manufacturer's\
  \ instructions for continued airworthiness.  Aeromotive \nhad not record ed the\
  \ manufacture r's mandatory service bulletins  that had been  carried out , or \n\
  checked  as having already been carried out,  during  the conformity inspection\
  \ . Two service \nbulletins issued by the manufacturer of the magnetos had been\
  \  required t o be carried out, but \nthere was no  record that they had been ,\
  \ prior to  the magnetos being released to service.  One \nof them  (Service Bulletin\
  \ TCM SB658 ) relate d to inspecting the distributor gear .  The other \n(TCM SB663A\
  \ ) was for an inspection of the tachometer  (governor)  breaker points inside the\
  \ \nright magneto . \n \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n Final report AO -2013 -002 4.3.9.  The\
  \ standard s of maintenance and inspection for the import and eventual release to\
  \ service \nof th is helicopter engine cannot be considered to have met the standard\
  \ s of aviation \nmaintenance best practice.  The Civil Aviation guidelines (AC\
  \ 00 -1) for importing aircraft parts \nfrom overseas  and determining the ir acceptability\
  \  had not been followed . The engine 's history \nand the lack of appropriate accompanying\
  \ documentati on meant  it should have been \nsubjected to more rigorous inspection\
  \ s.  At least four manufacturers ' mandatory service \nbulletins for engine components\
  \ had not been  recorded in the engine's logbook as having \nbeen previously carried\
  \ out , and they were not carried out by Aeromotive before the engine \nwas released\
  \ to service.  \n4.3.10.  The CAA released  Advisory Ci rcular AC 00 -1 to assist\
  \  purchasers and installers of aircraft parts  \nin identify ing parts that we\
  \ re unacceptable to use on type -certificated aircraft. It empha sised \nthe need\
  \ to assess  the accompanying documents  for errors and omissions , and to be wary\
  \ of \ncertain indicators of suspect parts, such as  low price s and incomplete\
  \ service histor ies. The \nguidance also stated that purchasers should aim to ensure\
  \ complete  traceability and quality, \nand that they should not place installers\
  \ in the position of accepting responsibility for \nunacceptable part s. \n4.3.11.\
  \  However, a p urchaser  may not be able to establish the quality of a  part if\
  \ they are buying from \noverseas , and will not necessarily be familiar with the\
  \  accompanying  documentation and \nmaintenance records that provide traceability\
  \ .   \n4.3.12.  In this case there was no release certificate accompanying  the\
  \ engine  when purchased , which \nmeant that it had to be sent to a n aviation\
  \ mainten ance organisation  certified under Civil \nAviation Rule part 145  for\
  \ a conformity inspection in order to  have a release certificate issued. \nThis\
  \ had to be done before it could be installed in a type -certificated aircraft in\
  \ New Zealand. \nIn accordance with AC  00-1, the ultimate responsibility for accepting\
  \ the part was on the \ninstaller.  However , in this case,  when the engine was\
  \ received by the installer it  had already  \nbeen through  a conformity inspection\
  \ and  issued  with a release certifi cate by a  Part 145 \ncompany . This document,\
  \ also known as a Form One,  stated  that it was fit for service and \neligible\
  \ for installation. Therefore  the company  certifying the conformity inspection\
  \ , which  was \naware of the engine 's involvement in a previous accident overseas,\
  \ had the greatest \nresponsibility for ensur ing the acceptability of the engine\
  \ before issuing the release certificate.  \n4.3.13.  The CAA had issued guidelines\
  \ (AC 145 -1) for Part 145 companies, which  listed the \nprocedures that should\
  \ be included in a conformity inspec tion for an item of unknown origin. \nThese\
  \ procedur es involved inspecting the item for conformity to specifications, drawings,\
  \  \ndimensions, type of material and state of preservation. The guidelines  also\
  \ require d an \nassess ment of  the item 's airworthiness sta tus, including Airworthiness\
  \ Directive s and the \ntraceability of life limits, and a functional test if applicable.\
  \ The guidelines did not specify what \nwas to be done if the state of preservation\
  \ was substandard, the service history was \nincomplete  or the acc ompanying documents\
  \ were incorrectly completed. They  also did not \nexplain when functional testing\
  \ was required  to be carried out,  and what it should entail . The \nguidelines\
  \  did not dif ferentiate between a new item and  a used item , or state which \
  \ \nspecifications , design or performance,  should be checked.   It was up to the\
  \ Part 145 company \nto develop its own procedures from the guidelines and decide\
  \  on the level s of disassembly, \ninspection and functional testing required for\
  \ each  conformity inspecti on.  \n4.3.14.  The CAA had not released  training material\
  \  specifically  for engineers  who carried out this type \nof conformity inspection\
  \ , and it was left up to the Part 145 companies to train their staff in the \n\
  procedures  involved .  Part 145 companies routinely relie d on the training provided\
  \ during  CAA-\nrun Inspection Authorisation  courses  to educate their staff on\
  \ the procedures.  However , this \ntype of conformity inspection was not covered\
  \ during the Inspection Authorisation  course.  In \nthis case, the procedures used\
  \  during the conformity inspection  did not ensure that the engine \nwas acceptable\
  \ for installation .  This  suggests that the CAA should issue further guidance\
  \ to \nPart 145 companies for carrying out this type of inspection . \n  \n \nFinal\
  \ report AO -2013 -002 \n<< Page 13 >>\n 4.3.15.  The engine loss of power was most\
  \ likely to have been caused by the oil in the right magneto, \nwhich was the result\
  \ of a simple maintenance error.  If this was the case, the non -adherence \nto\
  \ CAA guidance and the failure to  perform mandatory service bulletins were  unlikely\
  \ to have \ncontribute d to the engine power loss.  Nevertheless, similar standards\
  \ of inspection and \nmaintenance could result in accidents and incidents in future\
  \ unless the standard s are  \nimproved . \nFindings  \n1. The most likely cause\
  \ of the engine power loss was a malfunction of th e engine's \nright magneto. \
  \ The malfunction was likely caused by engine oil accumulating in \nthe magneto\
  \ because an oil slinger  was omitted during a maintenance \nprocedure.  \n2. The\
  \ imported second -hand engine and its accessories  had not been sub jected to \n\
  the inspection s and maintenance  required for continued airworthiness  before \n\
  they were released to service.  \n3. The regulator's guidelines  for inspecting\
  \ used parts of unknown origin were  not \nwell defined, and the company's approved\
  \ procedures developed from these \nguidelines were not adequate in this case. \
  \ \n4.4. Wearing of l ife jackets  \n4.4.1.  A major power loss when departing from\
  \ or returning to a shore landing site  can lead to  a \nditching.  A less -controlled\
  \ ditching, or a ditching into deeper water, could have had a less \nfavourable\
  \  outcome  in this incident .  The operator had complied with the regulatory \n\
  requirement for the carriage of life jackets , but the occupants  were not required\
  \ to wear them \nunder normal circumstances.  After entering autorotation the pilot\
  \ did not in struct the \npassengers to don the ir life jackets, and being at a\
  \ low height there was very little time for \nthem to have done so before the ditching\
  \ . \n4.4.2.  There is now a wide range of life jackets  available that allow quick\
  \ donning .  For example , the \npouch -type jacket  is secured to a person  by\
  \ a belt.  The jacket  can be pulled out of the pouch  \nand put over the head as\
  \ soon as a need is indicated, and activated  once clear of the aircraft .  \nA\
  \ life jacket  of this type would have been appropriate for the operator to have\
  \ provided  and, as \ndiscussed below, require d to be worn  on flights operated\
  \ from the lakeside base.  T he Civil \nAviation R ules prescribe the minimum safety\
  \ requirements.  O perators should anticipate the \nrisks that are specific to their\
  \ operation s and pla n adequately for them.    \n4.4.3.  The Commission has an\
  \ open safety recommendation , made to the Director of Civil Aviation, \nconcern\
  \ ing the carriage of life jackets  on flights where a ditching is likely  to have\
  \ a better \noutcome than a forced landing on unfavourable terrain (recommendation\
  \ 037/08).   That \nrecommendation recognise s that an aircraft could be within\
  \ gliding (or autorotation) range of a \nshore and therefore not required to be\
  \ equipped with life  jackets , but if the shoreline is hostile \nand does  not\
  \ afford a reasonable landing site a ditching could be inevitable.  Therefore, it\
  \ \nwould be sensible for life jackets  to be carried . \n4.4.4.  The present incident\
  \  is a reminder that much less time is available for helicopter occupants  to \n\
  find and fit their life jackets  than there is for aeroplane occupants  faced with\
  \ a ditching from \nthe same height.  The Commission is recommending that the Director\
  \ of Civil Aviation act on \nthe earlier recommendation by encouraging operators\
  \  of single -engine aircraft  flying  over \nwater to use quick -donning life jackets\
  \  when a ditching is the only or the preferable forced \nlanding option .  This\
  \ is particularly  warranted in situations where  a ditching could be carried \n\
