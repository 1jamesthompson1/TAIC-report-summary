  \ in conditions of low rail adhesion is a predictable risk applicable to any rail\
  \ \nsystem.  The causes of low adhesion may vary from one country, region or town\
  \ to the next, but \nthe effect  is the same : braking in low -adhesion conditions\
  \ will increase the distance required to \nstop a train .   \n4.1.2.  We know that\
  \ l ow rail-adhesion conditions existed  in both of the Melling  accidents  because\
  \ \nwheel -slide  protection activities were recorded by the train data loggers\
  \ .  However, the e xact \nlocation s of any low -adhesion area (s), the extent\
  \ of each area or areas, and the actual level s of \nlow adhesion  present at the\
  \ time were  not able to be determined . \n4.1.3.  There was nothing in the condition\
  \ of the train wheels or the profile of the rail that w ould ha ve \nadversely affected\
  \ the wheel -to-rail contact patch . \n4.1.4.  The driver of the Melling 2 train\
  \ tested positive for the presence  of cannabis  metabolites in his \nurine .  The\
  \ investigation was un able to establish whether his performance on the day was\
  \ \nimpaired by the effect s of cannabis.  However, the use of performance -impairing\
  \ substances by \ntrain drivers is a significant safety issue.  \n4.1.5.  As the\
  \ following analysis show s, a factor contributing to ea ch accident was that the\
  \ train \nbraking system did not perform as well as it could have in the low -adhesion\
  \ conditions.  \n4.1.6.  A key safety issue was that the National Rail System Standards\
  \ (NRSS)  did not require the \nMatangi braking system to be tested under slipp\
  \ ery track conditions against an appropriate \nstandard.  Consequently the train\
  \ brake system had not been optimised for  low-adhesion \nconditions . \n4.1.7.\
  \  The analysis discusses what happened in each case leading up to the collision.\
  \   \n4.1.8.  Consider ation is also given to : the performance of the train braking\
  \ system ; driver training in \nrespect of  the difference s between the Ganz Mavag\
  \ and Matangi braking systems ; and the \nmanagement  of risk to trains operating\
  \  into terminating stations , which  had not kept pace with \nindustry changes.\
  \  \n4.2. Interpretation of evidence  \nMelling 1  \n4.2.1.  The driver of the Melling\
  \ 1 train had braked smoothly down to 47 km/h by the time his train \nreached the\
  \ start of  the platform .  This was below the maximum  speed of 50 km/h .  When\
  \ he \nincreased the brake demand from 31% to 50% the wheels lost adhesion and began\
  \ to slide.  \nThe dynamic brakes in the motor car were the only brakes in use at\
  \ the time and the traction \ncontrol units attempted to control the wheel slide.\
  \  The train was about 52 m from the stop \nblock and  it would travel that distance\
  \ in about six seconds.  \n4.2.2.  The driver applied  full service brake , then\
  \ full pneumatic  brake9, followed by the emergency \nbrake.  The c omputer -controlled\
  \ brake system responded by disabl ing the dynamic brakes .  \nThen it increase\
  \ d the friction brake force on both the motor car and the trailer .  As the friction\
  \ \nbrake force increased, the wheels continued to slide .  The applied brake force\
  \ was limited by \nthe wheel -slide  protection  system  while it attempted  to\
  \ optimi se the train brak ing force .  The \ntrain braking system  was unable to\
  \ apply  an effective brake force  in the time available .  The \ntrain  collided\
  \ with the stop block at 0754  at an estimated speed of 25 km/h .   \n4.2.3.  The\
  \ speeds and brake actions are presented graphically in Appendix 1.  \n        \
  \                                                \n9 Applying full pneumatic brake\
  \ is effectively applying emergency brake.  \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final report RO\
  \ -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 Melling 2  \n4.2.4.  The Melling 2 driver started\
  \ decelerati ng his train 1.2 kilometre s from the Melling Station stop \nblock\
  \ by selecting ' off' with the power/brake  control  lever .  He increased the brake\
  \ to 23% then \nreduced it to 18% when the train was about 525 m fro m the stop\
  \ block .  At 430  m out from the \nstop block, the wheels started to slide.  The\
  \ train was travelling at 58 km/h and the computer -\ncontrolled braking system\
  \ was using dynamic brakes only.  The traction control units were \nunable to control\
  \ the wheel slide within three seconds , so the computer -controlled brake \nsystem\
  \ disabled the dynamic brakes and increased the friction brake force in the motor\
  \ car.  \n4.2.5.  The driver  had also  realised that the train was not slowing\
  \ at the rate he expected , so he \nincreased br ake demand to 50%, and then to\
  \ 100%.  The computer -controlled brake system \nresponded by increasing the friction\
  \ brake force in the trailer car to about 75% , which caused \nthe trailer car wheels\
  \ to slide  also.  Four seconds later the driver applied full pneu matic brake ,\
  \ \nfollowed by emergency brake.   \n4.2.6.  After the dynamic brakes were disabled,\
  \ the wheel -slide  protection  units fluctuated  the \nfriction brake  force  in\
  \ both cars in an attempt  to control the slide  until the train hit  the stop \n\
  block  at an estimated speed of 35 km/h .  The wheel -slide  protection  systems\
  \  were  unable to \nregain an effective rate of deceleration over  the last 430\
  \ m (see Appendix 1  for distances \nand speeds ).   \n \n4.2.7.  The driver of\
  \ the Melling 2 train test ed positive for cannabis , which  is of concern. The\
  \ \nCommission has included substance use on its ' watch list' and encourages regulators\
  \ and \noperators to put measu res in place to prevent substance impairment by persons\
  \ in safety -\ncritical roles. It was not possible to determine whether the driver\
  \ was impaired at the time of \nthe accident.    \n4.2.8.  Although cannabis impairment\
  \ reduces with time since exposure it affects people differently \nand is known\
  \ to impair  the executive cognitive function of informat ion processing .  Other\
  \ \nexecutive functions affected are planning, decision -making, risk taking, and\
  \ working memory.   \nAll of these functions are crucial for a train driver to operat\
  \ e safely (see Appendix 5 for more \ndetails).  \nConditions common to both accid\
  \ ents \n4.2.9.  Both drivers were handling their trains in a normal way.  They\
  \ approached Melling Station within \nthe speed limit for the line and they were\
  \ on target to reduce the train speed to less than 50 \nkm/h by the time they reached\
  \ the start of the platform.   \n4.2.10.  Both drivers said that they had been \
  \ alert and focused upon the task and not distracted.  They \nhad had light duty\
  \ schedules with adequate periods of rest  in the days leading up to their \nrespective\
  \ accidents .  Cell phone records proved that the drivers were  not engaged in text\
  \ or \nvoice communications at the time.  Therefore , fatigue and distraction were\
  \ very unlikely to have \nbeen factor s in either accident.   \n4.2.11.  The train\
  \ event recorders  showed that the train wheel -slide  protection system activated\
  \  in both \naccidents , meaning  that low adhesion was a common factor.  \n4.2.12.\
  \  Both trains were repaired sufficiently for the brakes to be tested on the track.\
  \  Repairs were \nlimited to facilitate a safe test run but all brake equipment\
  \ and brake -controller software were  \nkept as they originally were  during the\
  \ accidents.  Test runs were conducted by KiwiRail \nengineers on dry track around\
  \ the Wellington rail network, with a Commission observer on \nboard.  Several brake\
  \ test runs from a steady speed to a full stop were a lso conducted using \nvarious\
  \ combinations of brake selection, pneumatic brake and emergency brake.   \n4.2.13.\
  \  These test runs proved that the train brake s were  working on both trains at\
  \ the time of the \naccidents , and that each train conformed to the NRSS standard\
  \ fo r stopping distances on dry \ntrack.  \n  \nFinal report RO -2013 -103 and\
  \ RO -2014 -103 \n<< Page 15 >>\n 4.2.14.  The Commission engaged MetService to\
  \ analyse data on the weather conditions preceding both \naccidents.  They concluded\
  \ that in both cases dew was likely to have formed on the track and \nthat the weather\
  \ conditions preceding  each accident had been dry for several days.  These were\
  \ \nthe ideal circumstances for low -adhesion conditions to exist.  \n4.2.15.  Several\
  \ dry days preceding the accident s would have allowed a layer of natural deposits\
  \ to form \non the top of the rail , which was then f ollowed by the formation of\
  \ dew.  The resulting mixture \nwould have created a low -adhesion layer between\
  \ the rail and the train wheels . \n4.3. Management of infrastructure risk at terminating\
  \ stations  \nThe line speed limit  \n4.3.1.  The maximum line speed for approaching\
  \  Melling Station was 70 km/h. Drivers were taught to \naim to have the ir train\
  \ speed s at below 50 km/h  by the time the train s reache d the beginning of \n\
  the platform.  The line speed is set dependin g on the geometry of the track.  From\
  \ a risk \nperspective, Mell ing is a terminating station, meaning the consequences\
  \ of overrunning the \nplatform are much higher than at non-terminating stations.\
  \  The same applies to the target \nspeed for when the train reaches the start of\
  \ the platform.  Any train malfunction , low tra ck \nadhesion  or underperformance\
  \ of the train braking system risks the train colliding with the stop \nblock. \
  \ \n4.3.2.  The Commission recommended that KiwiRail reassess the speed limit for\
  \ trains approaching \nMelling Station, and that it also reassess the speed limit\
  \ f or trains approaching other \nterminating stations on the rail network.  KiwiRail\
  \ has since accepted these recommendations \nand addressed the safety issue.  \n\
  The stop block  \n4.3.3.  The concrete stop block had been  installed in  1954.\
  \  It lacked the impact -absorbing qual ities of \nmore modern stop blocks.  The\
  \ less effective they are, the greater the damage to the train and \nits occupants,\
  \ as both these collisions demonstrated.   The Commission recommended that \nKiwiRail\
  \ replace the concrete stop block with a more appropriate shock -absorbing system\
  \ \nsimilar to the type being installed in Auckland at the time.  KiwiRail accepted\
  \ this \nrecommendation and replaced the stop block.  \nThe overhead power  \n4.3.4.\
  \  There were two issues with the overhead traction power system .  Firstly, the\
  \ terminal pole was \nhit by the Melling 2 train because it was directly in the\
  \ path of the train when it collided with and \noverran  the stop block.  The force\
  \ of the collision severed the pole, causing the live overhead \nwire to dro op\
  \ and contact the train.   \n4.3.5.  The Commission recommended that KiwiRail relocate\
  \ the terminal pole out of line with a direct \noverrun.  This has since been completed\
  \ with a new cantilevered pole mounted off to one side \nof the rail centreline\
  \ and the safety reco mmendation  has been  closed.  \n4.3.6.  When the contact\
  \ wire dro oped and touched the train, it tripped the electrical protection \nsystem,\
  \ which led to t he second issue .  The traction controller at the Wellington National\
  \ Train \nControl Centre reset the power before the  driver was able to warn train\
  \ control of the accident.  \nThe Commission raised with KiwiRail the risk of promptly\
  \ resetting the overhead power  without \nfirst establishing the reason for the\
  \ system tripping . \n4.3.7.  After two further incidents KiwiRail submitted to\
  \ the Commission in December 2014 that it had \naccepted its concerns about promptly\
  \ resetting the overhead power after a protection trip .  \nKiwiRail then  issued\
  \ an internal memo to change its operating procedures.  Based on this \naction the\
  \ Commission did not i ssue a safety recommendation.  \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final\
  \ report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 4.4. Train brake performance  \nBrake performance\
  \ expectations  \n4.4.1.  Appendix 2 demonstrates the best theoretical stopping\
  \  distance for a Matangi train in low -\nadhesion conditions .  It assumes that\
  \  the wheel -slide protection system s operate perfectly to \ncontrol the wheel\
  \ creep and allow the maximum brake effort to be applied in the  conditions.  \n\
  The calculation shows that a  train with a typical passenger load for Melling could\
  \  decelerate at \n0.49 m/ s2 to stop in 197 m from 50 km/h  using full service\
  \ brake  in low -adhesion conditions \n(at 5%) .   \n4.4.2.  In the Melling 2 accident\
  \ (see details in Appendix 1) the train managed to decelerate at 0.3 \nm/s2 over\
  \ the first 251 m, reducing to 0.015 m/s2 over the remaining 179 m , and only slow\
  \ by \n23 km/h  but not stop in the total distance of 430 m.  This comparison between\
  \ theoretical and \nactual brake performance indicated that either the adhesion\
  \ was much less than 5% or there \nwas a performance issue with the train brakes\
  \ in low -adhesion conditions , or that there was a \ncombination of both factors\
  \ . \n4.4.3.  The train commissioning tests conducted by the manufacturer established\
  \ that the train braking \nsystem performed to the GWRC procurement specification\
  \ .  These tests  included extensive test \nruns with various c ombinations of brake\
  \ application and some with simulated low -adhesion \nconditions.  The overall \
  \ requirement was that the train complied with NRSS /6 - Engineering \nInteroperability\
  \  Standard , Version 1 ( NRSS/6 ) to stop within 460 m from a speed of 100 km/h\
  \ \nin all normal climatic conditions.   Testing proved that the train met  the\
  \ NRSS /6 stopping \ndistance requirements.   \n4.4.4.  The commissioning test specification\
  \ did not require the train braking and  wheel -slide  \nprotection systems to be\
  \ tested in controlled low-adhesio n condition s in accordance with  an \ninternationally\
  \ recognised standard10, nor was it required by any other authority .   \n4.4.5.\
  \  To investigate  the performance of the brake system , GWRC agreed to conduct\
  \ a series of brake \ntests in low-adhesion  conditions and measure the performance\
  \ of the Matangi brake system.  \nLow-adhesion brake test  program me \n4.4.6. \
  \ The tests  proved that in low-adhesion  conditions the current configuration of\
  \ the computer -\ncontrolled brake system did not perform as well as it could ha\
  \ ve.  Several opportunities for \nimproving the train brake performance were identified\
  \ and trialled. These include d:  \n                                           \
  \             \n10 For example, UIC 541 -05. Finding s \n1. It is very likely that\
  \ for both collisions with the stop block at Melling Station , an extended \nperiod\
  \ of dry weather combined with the formation of dew on the rail resulted in a \n\
  condition of low rail adhesion along the approach to the station.  \n2. It was not\
  \ possible to determine whether the driver of the Melling 2 train was impaired by\
  \ \ncannabis.  However, the fact that he had cannabis in his system is a serious\
  \ safety issue.  \n3. Both trains were travelling at a normal speed of approach\
  \ to Melling Station and both \ndrivers applied a normal braking technique during\
  \ the approach.  \n4. The operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning\
  \ the platform at \nMelling Station and colliding with the stop block had not been\
  \ adequately considered.  No \nspecial speed restriction for the approach had been\
  \ set; the stop block was an older and \nless effective design  than its modern\
  \ equivalent ; and the pole carrying the overhead \ntraction power line was placed\
  \ directly behind the stop  block where it was prone to \ndamage.    \n  \nFinal\

  \  As a result of the test programme, GWRC initiate d corrective actions  to improve\
  \ the low-\nadhesion  brake performance  and approved software changes.  The first\
  \ software upgrade was  \nrolled out across the Matangi fleet in 2015 . \n4.4.8.\
  \  The test programme raised  a further concern  that t he wheel -slide  protection\
  \  system for the \nfriction brakes was not performing in accordance with the UIC\
  \ 541 -05 standard11.  GWRC \narranged for the brake manufacturer to conduct a more\
  \ rigorous test of the wheel -slide \nprotection units in a test facility in Italy.\
  \ This resulted in a  further software u pgrade to improve \nthe performance of\
  \ the friction brake wheel -slide  protecti on system in low-adhesion  conditions.\
  \  \nThis software upgrade was  rolled out across the fleet in mid-2016 .   \n4.4.9.\
  \  Following the testing program me and the software changes to the train brake\
  \ system , the \nMatangi train brake performance in low-adhesion  conditions was\
  \ noticeably improved.   \n4.4.10.  However, t here are too many variables, unknowns\
  \ and possible scenarios to draw any definitive \nconclusions on whether the trains\
  \ would have stopped before the stop blocks if these \nimprovements had been made\
  \ when the trains were commissioned .  For example:  \n\uF0B7 the dew suspected\
  \ of causing the low adhesion evaporated soon after the events , so the \nextent\

  \ adhesion experienced by a train  \n\uF0B7 the control inputs from the drivers\
  \ could vary depending upon circumstances at the \ntime, such as : their choice\
  \  of speed and brake selections ; their knowledge about how \nthe brakes worked\
  \ ; and the response they had  each experienced with the brakes  during  \nthe accidents\
  \ . \nNew Zealand standards for train brakes  \n4.4.11.  It is concerning that t\
  \ he brake performance of a new and modern commuter train  was only \nmade to comply\
  \ with the basic requirements of NRSS /6.  The standard is silent on: low-\nadhesion\
  \  brake performance; wheel -slide  prevention systems; full train brake performance\
  \ \nacross different braking systems; and reference to appropriate international\
  \ standards.  \n4.4.12.  Although the selected train brake equipment ha d the capability\
  \ to perform well in low-adhesion  \nconditions, the brake performance specification\
  \ s did not require it to be verified. Therefore , the \nsystem was not set up for\
  \ optimum performance.  The current trend in Europe  is to test train \nbrakes to\
  \ local  standards12, with a complete train as a fully integrated brake system .\
  \  These \nstandards include the verification of wheel -slide  protection systems\
  \  in controlled low-adhesion  \nconditions  and the optimal integration of dynamic\
  \ and friction brakes . \n4.4.13.  The NRSS  was originally intended to provide\
  \ an interoperability framework for rail participants \nto meet when wishing to\
  \ operate on the rail network. It is still the only formal set of rail \nstandards\
  \ available in New Zealand.  \n                                                \

  \  \n\n<< Page 18 >>\n Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 4.4.14.  In\
  \ 2010 t he Commission issued three safet y recommendations to the Secretary for\
  \ Transport to \naddress safety issues relating to th e status of the NRSS.  As\
  \ a result of the Melling accidents \nthe Commission  issued a new recommendation\
  \ to the NZ Transport Agency in 2015 to review \nthe NRSS to ensure that low-adhesion\
  \  braking requirements were incorporated into the \nstandards and that they were\
  \ applicable to all trains intended to operate on the National Rail \nSystem.  The\
  \ Co mmission now has a total of seven open safety recommendations targeting \n\
  changes to the NRSS.  Three are to the Secretary of Transport and f our to the N\
  \ Z Transport \nAgency.  \n4.4.15.  The N Z Transport Agency is currently addressing\
  \ these recommendations by undertaking an \nindependent review to establish an appropriate\
  \ rail regulatory framework for the future.   In light \nof this review the Commission\
  \ makes no new recommendations on this safety issue.   \n4.5. Driver trainin g \n\
  4.5.1.  The Matangi driver conversion training suggested that  drivers  consider\
  \  the computer -controlled  \nbrake system as a 'black box' that performed  better\
  \ than the braking system in the older Ganz -\nMavag  train s.  This suggestion\
  \ was reinforced to the drivers when they experienced the Matangi  \ntrain's  effective\
  \ brakes on dry track.  \n4.5.2.  Critical information describing  how the computer\
  \ -controlled  brake system operated was not \nprovided in the conversion course\
  \ material  or in the Train Crew Manual.   Several drivers were \ninterviewed about\
  \ their understanding of  how the computer -controlled  braking system worked. \
  \ \nIt became evident that t he conversion training had not adequately inform ed\
  \ drivers about the \ndifferences between the two braking systems, particularly\
  \ in low-adhesion  conditions , and how \nthe brake effort  is shared between the\
  \ motor car and trailer . \n4.5.3.  A key difference was the Matangi's preference\
  \ for using dynamic brakes.  This reduced the \nnumber of braked wheels to just\
  \ those wheels on the motor car and consequently it required a \nhigher level of\
  \ adhesion to deliver that brake force.  The effect was that the Matangi would \n\
  experience wheel slide more often t han the Ganz -Mavag in low-adhesion  conditions.\
  \ (See \nAppendix 3 for more details .) \n4.5.4.  Another key difference between\
  \ these two train brake systems was how brake effort was shared \nbetween the motor\
  \ car and trailer.  The Matangi computer -controlled  brake system applied all \n\
  brake effort from the motor car before using the trailer car brakes.  The Ganz -Mavag\
  \ stepped \nthe brake effort sequentially in thirds.  The first step would apply\
  \ one-third  brake force from the \nmotor car , the next step would add one-third\
  \  to the  trailer, the next would increase the motor \ncar to two-thirds  and so\
  \ on until full service brake had been reached on each car.  \n4.5.5.  In a four-year\
  \ period , drivers encountered various brak ing problems with the newly \ncommissioned\
  \ trains , including dynamic brakes tripping out  and their being unable to stop\
  \ the \ntrain s at target point s.  The problems  sometimes resulted in platform\
  \ overruns , which were \nsubsequently reported to the regulator and the operator\
  \ but little progress was made in \nresolving the m.  This led to drivers losing\
  \ confidence in the braking system and to experiment  \nwith alternative braking\
  \ techniques or work -around actions.  \n4.5.6.  The operator did not have a best\
  \ practice  of braking in an emergency , so had left it to the \ndrivers ' discretion.\
  \  A benefit of the brake  test program me was drivers actually experiencing  \n\
  wheel -slide  protection  activity while braking on a safe and controlled low-adhesion\
  \  test track .  \nThe operator was subsequently able to define a best -practice\
  \ braking technique for low-\nadhesion  conditions and  retrain  its drivers  accordingly\
  \ .   \n4.6. Subsequent events  and preventive measures  \n4.6.1.  On 10 June 2015\
  \ at 1039 , a third Matangi train13 had a braking problem at Melling in low -\n\
  adhesion conditions.  The Commission made enquiries into the in cident and reviewed\
  \ the train \n                                                        \n13 Matang\
  \ i train FP/FT 4218  \n  \nFinal report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 \n<< Page\
  \ 19 >>\n data logger record.  The train had been upgraded with the new brake control\
  \ software and the \ndriver was aware of the new, best -practice , low-adhesion\
  \ braking technique.   \n4.6.2.  The train started to slide near the 'on -tracking\
  \ boards ' at the start of the straight into Melling \nStation , but the driver\
  \ recognised the wheel -slide protection activity and applied emergency \nbrakes.\
  \  The train was reported to have come to a stop from 35 km/h in 205 m , which \n\
  represents a deceleration rate of a pproximately 0.23 m/s2.  The point where it\
  \ stopped was \nbefore the platform , so the driver then crept the train forward\
  \ to the desired target stop point , \nwhere it was stopped normally.   \n4.6.3.\
  \  GWRC arranged for the wheel -slide activity to be presented to the driver's \
  \ screen of the train \nmanagement system.  This will help drivers to recognise\
  \ when low -adhesion conditions exist \nand to implement their defensive driving\
  \ techniques.  \n4.6.4.  GWRC took the initiative to organise a 'Low -adhesion working\
  \ group' in the Wellington area. The \ngroup has members from all aspects of the\
  \ rail industry , including the train operator, network \nmanager and infrastructure\
  \ owner.  The working group's purpose is to share information about \nlow-adhesion\
  \ conditions and collaboratively take action to  reduce its effect on operations\
  \ in the \nWellington rail network.  \n4.6.5.  In October 2016 GWRC started the\
  \ purchasing process for a Matangi train simulator to assist \nwith future driver\
  \ training.  Depending on the fidelity of the simulator controls, it could provid\
  \ e a \nmeans to better prepare drivers for handling low -adhesion conditions. \
  \  \n  Finding s \n5. The Matangi braking and wheel -slide  protection systems were\
  \ not performing as well as \nthey could have  because they had not been tested\
  \ against an appropriate standard and \ntuned for optimum  braking in low-adhesion\
  \  conditions before the trains were \ncommissioned to service.  \n6. It could not\
  \ be established whether either collision would have been prevented had the \nbrake\
  \ and wheel -slide  protection systems been operating to their optimum in  low-adhesion\
