- safety_issue: 'The National Rail System Standards (NRSS) did not require the Matangi braking system to be tested under slippery track conditions against an appropriate standard, resulting in the train brake system not being optimised for low-adhesion conditions.

- safety_issue: 'The concrete stop block installed in 1954 lacked the impact-absorbing qualities of more modern stop blocks, increasing the damage to the train and its occupants in the event of a collision.

- safety_issue: 'The overhead traction power system had issues that could increase the risk in the event of a collision, such as the terminal pole being directly in the path of an overrun train and the risk of promptly resetting the overhead power without first establishing the reason for the system tripping.

- safety_issue: 'The Matangi braking and wheel-slide protection systems were not performing as well as they could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for optimum braking in low-adhesion conditions before the trains were commissioned to service.

- safety_issue: 'The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in low-adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer-controlled brake and wheel-slide protection systems.

- safety_issue: 'The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel-slide protection systems.
