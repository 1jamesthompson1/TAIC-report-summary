The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may make recommendatio ns to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqu iries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. On 15 April 2013 a two -car Matangi passenger train was operating the service from Wellington 
to Melling Station.  As the train was slowing on the approach to Melling Station it encountered 
slippery track conditions , and despite the efforts of the train driver  the train collided with the 
stop block just pas t the station platform.  The train was damaged and three passengers 
received first aid , with one sustain ing minor injuries.  The force of the collision lifted the 
concrete stop block out of the ground.  
1.2. Just over one year later , on 27 May 2014, the same thing happened when another two -car 
Matangi passenger train collided with the stop block.  This time the train came to rest on top of 
the stop block.  The concrete block split and the terminal pole for the overhead power line, 
mounted directly behind the stop block, was severed at ground level.  The overhead contact 
wire drooped and momentarily touched the roof of the train, causing the electrical circuit 
breaker to trip for the area.  The train was extensively damaged and two pass engers received 
minor injuries.  
1.3. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission ( Commission ) found  that for both accidents 
dew forming on the railway track following a period of dry weather made the track slippery  
(referred to as low adhesion) .  Both train s were being driven normally but the drivers were 
caught unaware by the slippery track conditions.  
1.4. The Commission also found  that the training that drivers received for transitioning from the 
Ganz Mavag  train type  to the Matangi train type did not provide them with sufficient information 
in respect of the design and correct operation of the train brake and wheel -slide protection 
systems.  
1.5. The computer -controlled train braking system is sophisticated and is fitted with two 
independent wheel -slide  protection systems  to manage braking in slippery conditions .   Post-
accident testing revealed that the braking systems had not been optimised for slippery track  
conditions  when the trains were first commissioned into service.  
1.6. The Commission identified a safety issue  whereby the current National Rail System Standards  
did not require  new train types to have their train brake systems tested under slippery track 
conditions against an appropriate standard . 
1.7. The Commission also identified safety issues  with the assessment of risk for trains entering 
terminating stations.  The normal allowable train speeds left little margin for error in the event 
of something going wrong, and the stop block was an older type and was less effective at 
absorbing impact forces  than i ts modern equivalent .  Also, the pole supporting the overhead 
electrical traction line was directly in the path of an overrunning train.  
1.8. It was of concern to the Commission that the driver of the train in the second accident was 
found to have cannabis in h is system, although it does not believe that it was a contributory 
factor.  
1.9. The Commission made four urgent recommendations  to KiwiRail to address issues  to do with 
risk, and two further recommendations  to the N Z Transport Agency to ensure that low -adhesion 
braking requirements were  defined in rail standards and that the brake systems on the new 
Auckland electric train s were optimised for low -adhesion conditions . 
1.10.  Actions were  taken to address four of the recommendations, which were then closed before  this 
report was published.  The agencies involved have also made progress in addressing the 
remaining recommendations, and taken safety actions to address other safety issues identified 
in this re port.   Detail of the safety  actions taken are included in  sections six and seven  of this 
report .  In summary, they are:  
 The train brakes were tested and optimised  for slippery track conditions  
 The line speed into Melling Station was reduced and the line speed at  other 
terminal stations was reviewed and changed as  appropriate  

<< Page 2 >>
 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103  The stop block at Melling was replaced with a shock absorbing buffer stop  
 The traction power pole at Melling was relocated away from the track centreline  
 Matangi drivers received further training  on the Matangi brake systems  
 Overhead traction power reset procedures were changed  
 A low adhesion working group  was formed for the Wellington area  
 The procurement of a driver training simulator  for Matangi trains was initiated  
 The driving console in the Matangi trains was modified to alert  the driver  
whenever the train was experiencing wheelslide activity . 
1.11.  Key lessons  arising from this inquiry were : 
 Slippery track conditions are a foreseeable risk and train braking systems must 
be designed, tested and optimised to provide adequate braking performance 
under those conditions.  
 Train drivers must be adequately trained to be fully conversant with the 
characteristics of their train braking systems, and to drive their trains within the 
trains' capabilities.  
 When a new train type is being commissioned and firs t entered into service, 
train operators should seek feedback from the drivers on train performance in 
order to identify and remedy promptly any potential performance  issues.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. Notification and investigation  
2.1.1.  The NZ Transport Agency notified the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (the 
Commission ) of the first  accident at Melling Station soon after it had occurred  on 15 April 2013 .  
The Commission launched an inquiry  under section 13(1)b of the Transport Ac cident 
Investigation  Commission  Act 1990, to determine the causes and circumstances of the 
accident, and appointed an investigator in charge.  T wo investigators travelled to the site  that 
morning .   
2.1.2.  Evidence collected included  electronic records from  close d-circuit television and the train data 
logger , and  interviews with t he crew , relevant witnesses and other participants.  
2.1.3.  The Commission seized the train (referred to in this report as 'Melling 1 ') and allowed it to be 
partially repaired to enable a test r un.  A test run was conducted on 24 April 2013 on dry track .  
The test run  replicated the train's speed  into Melling Station and the driver's brake application s. 
2.1.4.  On 27 May  2014  a second train collided with the Melling Station stop block.  T he NZ Transport 
Agency notified the Commission of the second accident.  The Commission immediately opened 
a new inquiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act , and 
appointed the same investigator in charge . 
2.1.5.  The investig ation team attended the accident site to inspect the train,  gather  evidence and 
conduct interviews.  
2.1.6.  The Commission also seized the second train (referred to in this report as 'Melling 2 ') and 
allowed it to be towed  to KiwiRail's Wellington maintenance dep ot for further examination and 
testing.  
2.1.7.  The Melling 2 train sustained significant damage to the bogie1. The Commission required that 
repairs were restricted to allow  the brake operation to be tested  safely during a test run while 
ensuring that all of the original brake components and controller s remained as they were at the 
time of the accident .  This test run was carried out in February 2015 .   
Interim report  
2.1.8.  As the lines of inquiry for the two accidents were similar, the Commission combined the two 
inqui ries with a view to publishing one combined report.  In July 2014  the Commission 
published  an interim report to present the facts as they were known at the time , and made  four 
urgent recommendations  to KiwiRail to address immediate safety issues . 
Brake tests in low adhesion  
2.1.9.  One line of inquiry was  the performance of the Matangi brake systems in low-adhesion2 
conditions .  The Commission requested that Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC)  (the 
owner)  and Tranz  Metro3 (the operator)  jointly carry out  a full train  brake  test program me in 
controlled low -adhesion conditions.  
2.1.10.  GWRC  agreed to fund the test program me.  KiwiRail provide d the project test engineer  and 
support staff.  GWRC also arranged for specialist engineers from Hyundai Rotem ( the train 
manufacturer) and Faiveley (the brake system manufacturer) to participate .

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 2.1.11.  The Commission 's investigator  in charge attended two of the test runs  conducted in August 
2014 and December 2014.  The August series was intended  to establish suitable test 
conditi ons and prove the test equipment . The second series in December adopted 
improvements made after the first test ; software adjustments were made during this series to 
optimise the train brake performance in low -adhesion conditions .  
2.1.12.  The preliminary results from the test program me raised questions for  the Commission about the 
train's brake performance  in low -adhesion conditions .   
2.1.13.  The Commission issued two further recommendations to  the NZ Transport Agency on 26 March 
2015.  It also gave notice of these recommendations to Auckland Transport , which was  in the 
process of commissioning a similar  type of  train at the time.  
2.1.14.  On 24 August 2016  the Commission approved a draft report  to be sent to interested persons 
for comment.  
2.1.15.  The report was sent to 16 inter ested persons.  Submissions were received from four interested 
persons.  
2.1.16.  The Commission has considered in detail all submissions and any changes as a result of those 
submissions have been included in the final report.  
2.1.17.  On 2 November 2016 the Commission  approved the final report for publication.  
2.1.18.  On 24 November 2016 representatives of the GWRC appeared before the Commissioners to 
speak to their submission.  Any changes as a result of those discussions  have been included in 
the final report.

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Background  
3.1.1.  The Matangi train is a two -car electrical multiple unit comprising a motor car coupled to a trailer 
car.  Each car has two bogies , with two axles on each  bogie .  The wheels are fixed to the 
connecting axle and rotate as a unit.  The cars are a matched set but may be coupled to other 
sets to make a longer train.   
 
Figure 1 
The Matangi two -car set  
(Photo by Matthew25187 at en.wikipedia, CC BY -SA 3.0)  
3.1.2.  The driver normally  controls the train using a single power/brake lever  by moving it forward for 
acceleration and back for braking.  The selected power or brake setting is displayed on the 
driver's control screen.  A full-service train brake is when the power/brake position is moved to  
the 100% brake  position .  The computer -controlled brake system (see Figure 7) decides which 
type of brake system to use and the proportion of brake force to share between the motor car 
and the trailer car.   
3.1.3.  The brake system is designed to achieve a full service (100%) brake deceleration rate of 0.9 
metres per second per second  (m/s2) and an emergency brake deceleration rate of 1.2 m/s2 in 
normal conditions .  It achieves normal service braking  with a combination of friction and 
dynamic brake systems , but for emergency stops it only uses friction brakes .

Driver's controls  
Friction brakes  
3.1.4.  Friction brakes use air pressure to force a brake pad against a rotating surface to slow its 
rotational  speed .  Both car s are fitted with friction brakes , the motor car with wheel tread type 
and the trailer car with disc type.  Tread brakes force a brake pad against the rolling surface of 
the wheel (the wheel tread4).  Disc brakes are attached to the axle and the brake pads are 
clamped to either side of the disc by a brake caliper. The friction brakes act independently on 
each  car of the  two-car set.  
Dynamic brakes  
3.1.5.  The motor car is also fitted with dynamic brakes , which  use the magnetic fields generated in the 
electr ic tract ion motors to slow the wheels.  This creates a braking torque that is available only  
when the train is in motion.  The Matangi dynamic brakes act independently on each of the two 
motor car bogies.  
3.1.6.  Dynamic brakes  have an advantage over friction brakes in that they result in less  wear  to brake 
components .  The limitation of dynamic braking is that the train has to be moving within an 
acceptable speed window for it to be effective and available.  
Pneumatic brakes  
3.1.7.  A separate, manually operated pneumatic br ake lever is provided for drivers to operate the 
friction brakes.  This also acts as a backup if the computer -controlled brake system sh ould fail .  
The p neumatic brake act s equally on all axles of the train.

 Emergency brake  
3.1.8.  If a driver needs  to stop urgently, the power/brake lever can be moved farther back beyond the 
100% position into the emergency position.  This triggers the emergency brake control loop , 
which disables the dynamic brake and applies friction brakes  to both cars in the set .  The 
emer gency brake can be initiated by several different methods and is designed to  decelerate 
the train at a higher rate and stop in a shorter distance than it would with 100% brake.   
Melling Station  
3.1.9.  Melling Station is a terminal station at the end of the Melli ng Line.  The maximum line speed 
was 70 kilometres per hour ( km/h ) and the operator 's procedures require that when a train 
passes the start of the platform it is travelling slower than 50 km/h.  The end of the line ha d a 
concrete stop block to prevent trai ns over -running.  
3.2. Narrative  
Melling 1 accident  
3.2.1.  On 15 April 2013 a two -car Matangi train was operating the service from Wellington to Melling  
Station .  The weather was fine but dew had formed in the area, including on the rails.  The train 
was due to arrive at Melling Station at 0746 with a  driver, train manager and nine passengers 
on board.  As the train approached Melling Station , the driver began to apply the  brake but the 
train did not slow as quickly as he expected.   
3.2.2.  When the driver  realised that his train was not decelerating at the rate he required , he 
increased to full service brake , quickly followed by full pneumatic  brake , and finally  emergency 
brake.  However, the train continued past the station platform and  collided with the stop block.  
3.2.3.  The stop block was a partially buried concrete structure (see Figure 3).  The collision forced the 
stop block out of the ground and the train rebounded back but remained on the rails (see Figure 
4).

3.2.4.  Three passengers  were treated at the site.  One sustained minor injuries and went  to hospital 
for further  examination.  
Melling 2 accident  
3.2.5.  Just over o ne year later , on 27 May  2014 , a two-car Matangi train  operating from Wellington to 
Melling  also collided with the stop block at Melling Station .  The train had departed from 
Western Hutt Station shortly after 0808 with the driver, a train manager and 10 passengers on 
board and was due to arrive at Melling Station at 0809.   The driver was on his second trip to 
Melling that morning with th e same  train  when the accident occurred.    
3.2.6.  About 5 00 metres  (m) from the stop block  with minimum brak ing applied , the driver realised 
that the train was not slowing as  expected .  He increased to full service  brak e then to 
emergency , and then h e applied full pneumatic brake.  Realis ing that his train would collide with 
the stop block , he pressed the emergency brake button .  He  then opened the door to his driving 
cab and called out to warn the passengers to brace themselves , then braced himself for  the 
collision . 
3.2.7.  The train collided with the concrete stop block that had been reinstalled after Melling 1 (see 
Figure 5 and Figure 6).

3.2.8.  The train came to rest on top  of the stop block .  The concrete block split and the terminal pole  
for the overhead power line , mounted di rectly behind the stop block, was severed at ground 
level.  The overhead contact wire drooped and momentarily touched the roof of the train .

3.2.9.  When the live contact wire touched the train, it tripped the circuit breaker in the local electrical 
substation.  The  KiwiRail  traction controller on duty at the time in the Wellington National Train 
Control C entre noted  that the circuit breaker had tripped .  The train controller called the Melling 
2 driver on the radio but did not get a response , so the train controller and the traction 
controller agreed they would reset the circuit breaker  remotely .   


<< Page 10 >>
 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 3.2.10.  A KiwiRail employee, who had been waiting to board the train as a passenger, recognised the 
potential electrical hazard to the public and prevented people on the platform touching the train 
until the overhead wire had been made safe.  
3.2.11.  The train manager attended to the passengers, checked for injuries and performed first aid as 
required.  The driver  went to the rear cab to use the radio to call trai n control.  He report ed the 
accident,  request ed that the overhead power supply be made safe, and asked for emergency 
services  to attend . 
3.2.12.  Emergency services attended the scene and secured the train from public  access .  Ambulance 
staff entered the train through the emergency door at the rear to attend to one passenger with 
minor injuries and another in shock.  The passenger doors remained closed for 22 minutes 
after the accident, until the train was deemed  safe for passengers to exit.  
3.3. The drivers  
3.3.1.  At the time of the Melling 1 accident in 2013, the driver had 11 years ' driving experience with 
the operator.  He had converted from the Ganz Mavag type train to drive  the newer Matangi 
type train in 2011 and had been driving them regularly since.   He was tested under the 
operator's standard policy for the presence of drugs and alcohol and found to be clear.  
3.3.2.  At the time of the Melling 2 accident in 2014 t hat driver had 11.5 years' driving experience with 
the operator .  He had been driving the Matangi trains since they were introduced in 2011 .  After 
the accident the driver was tested under the operator's standard policy for the presence of 
drugs and alcohol .  He  had a positive result for THC acid5 in his urine  (further information on the 
effects of cannabis is provided in Appendix 5).  
3.4. Computer -controlled brake system  
3.4.1.  The Matangi brakes are controlled by computers  (control units) .  The control units  read a 
driver's brake demand signal and each activate s an appro priate brake force depending on the 
speed and weight of the train at the time (see Figure 7).  The control units  each respond 
independently to the demand signal by calculating the required brake force.  The control units  
then  check how much brake force can be achieved using dynamic brakes  and back off an 
equivalent friction brake force to ensure that dynamic is the preferred  brake force.

<< Page 11 >>
 3.4.2.  As the train slows down, there is a point where dynamic braking cannot generate enough brake 
force.  At around 14 km/h the friction brakes are blended in and dynamic brakes faded out.   
3.5. Rail adhesion  
3.5.1.  Adhesion, in rail terminology, refers to the degree of g rip, or friction, between a train wheel  tread  
and the top surface of the rail  head .  Adhesion is the same as the friction coefficient but 
expressed as a percentage.  The normal range for adhesion on rail is between 12% and 40% 
(see Appendix 4 for more info rmation on adhesion).  
3.5.2.  Any brake application to a wheel will slow its rotating speed, which is transferred through the 
contact patch6 between the wheel and the rail as a decelerating brake force.  If the brake force 
is greater than the maximum adhesion force possible in the conditions, the wheel will begin to 
slide7.  The effects of low adhesion upon a train are that the wheels may slid e under braking 
and stopping distances will be longer.  
3.5.3.  The Matangi procurement specification required the brake system designer to nominate the 
minimum adhesion level that its equipment would need  to achieve the specified deceleration 
rates.  The nominated  levels were 9.6% adhesion for full service braking and 14.2% adhesion 
for emergency braking . 
3.5.4.  Low adhesion as described in this report is when the adhesion  is 10% or less .  A subset of this 
condition is that when the adhesion is under 5%  it can be termed very low adhesion.  Low 
adhesion is an operational risk for train operators , while the very low adhesion condition is an 
important consideration for equipment designers.   Any change to the interface between the rail 
and the wheel , such as the presence of wa ter, leaves or grease , may affect the adhesion.   
3.5.5.  The most common cause of low adhesion is when a light layer of moisture forms or collects on 
the top of the rail.  This may be caused by morning dew, light rain or mist.  When the moisture 
combines with oth er contaminants normally found on a rail , such as dirt, rust, brake dust or 
solid particles of air pollutants, it can form a slurry that acts as a lubricant.  In heavy rain this 
slurry tends to wash off the rail top and thus low adhesion becomes less of a problem.  
3.6. Wheel -slide  protection  system  
3.6.1.  If a wheel starts to slide while a train is braking, its ability  to apply an effective braking force  
through the contact patch  is reduced .  However , a small amount of controlled wheel slide can 
optimi se the brak e force .  A wheel -slide  protection8 system allows a braked train wheel to rotate 
up to 20% slower than the train speed to achieve the most effective braking force in low -
adhesion conditions.  However, t he actual train speed is not usually measured by these 
systems .  Instead, it relies on a software -derived value analogous to the train speed called the 
'reference speed '. The system will  override  the brake force applied by the driver to keep the 
wheel speed  within the 20% band below the reference  speed.  The Matangi has two types of 
wheel -slide  protection system.  
3.6.2.  One wheel -slide  protection system is a software application within another controller .  It resides 
in the two traction control units (see  Figure 7) and is effective only when dynamic braking is in 
use.  The other  wheel -slide  protection system is a dedicated , stand -alone , computerised control 
unit that only works with the pneumatic friction brake s.  A system of this type is fitted to both 
the motor  and the trailer  cars.  It continuously monitors for wheel slide and operates whenever 
wheel slide is detected while the friction brakes are in use.  This wheel -slide  protection  system is 
disabled w hen the train speed  drops below 5 km/h . 
                                                        
6 The contact patch is t he rolling contact area between a train wheel tread and the top surface of the rail 
head . 
7 Wheel slide is a condition where the rotational speed of a wheel is less than that corresponding to the 
actual linear speed of  the train . 
8 Wheel -slide protection is a  control system that limits any applied brake force  during times of reduced 
adhesion  to utilise the maximum available adhesion and to prevent the wheels locking up. It is analogous to 
anti-lock braking on a motor ca r.

England  
3.7.1.  In 2005 the Rail Accident Investigation Branch in England investigated a series of low -adhesion -
related events that occurred in 2004 and 2005  (RAIB, 2005) .  The investigation identified two 
key points that were relevant to New Zealand .  One was that operators used past  events  to 
predict  low adhesion rather than just monitor ing current conditions or risk .  The second point 
was that the train operating companies  did not understand the characteristics of the ir new 
trains .  That lack of understanding led to inadequate briefing of drivers and suboptimal 
performance of the wheel -slide  protection  systems.   
3.7.2.  The report also highlighted : a lack of industry knowled ge on the cause of low adhesion;  a lack of 
test procedures to optimise the performance of whole -train braking systems with wheel -slide  
protection ; and that further research  was required to find the optimum set-up parameters for 
wheel -slide  protection  systems.  
Melbourne, Australia  
3.7.3.  In Melbourne a series of incidents occurred in 2009 in which  trains failed to brake effectively 
and overran  platforms.  The Office of the Chief Investigator Transport Safety investigated  
(OCITS, 2009)  and f ound several contributory factors . The listed contributory factors were : 
 moisture on the rail caused low -adhesion conditions  
 the Nexas trains' braking system response to a wheel -slide  event  
 the Nexas trains did not have tread brakes , which could have other wise helped 
to clean the wheel tread surface and improved braking  
 the train's very good dry -track braking performance may have raised drivers ' 
expectations in low -adhesion conditions  
 drivers did not have a sufficient depth of understanding of how the Nexas 
braking system worked or specific guidance on operational procedures when 
encountering low adhesion  
 the n etwork risk management of low -adhesion conditions was inadequate at the 
time 
 low-adhesion braking performance requirements were not adequately de fined in 
the procurement specification s nor verified in acceptance tests . 
Queensland, Australia  
3.7.4.  In 2013 a Queensland Rail passenger train failed to stop at a platform and collided with the 
end-of-line buffer stop.  The train rode up over the buffer stop an d onto the platform , where it 
flattened the mast for the overhead power line and came to rest inside the station building.  The 
train had encountered low -adhesion conditions and the driver's actions were not contributory.  
The Australian Transport Safety B ureau's report into the accident listed the main contributing 
factor  as the operator's inadequate management of low -adhesion risk  (ATSB, 2013) .

 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  Operating trains in conditions of low rail adhesion is a predictable risk applicable to any rail 
system.  The causes of low adhesion may vary from one country, region or town to the next, but 
the effect  is the same : braking in low -adhesion conditions will increase the distance required to 
stop a train .   
4.1.2.  We know that l ow rail-adhesion conditions existed  in both of the Melling  accidents  because 
wheel -slide  protection activities were recorded by the train data loggers .  However, the e xact 
location s of any low -adhesion area (s), the extent of each area or areas, and the actual level s of 
low adhesion  present at the time were  not able to be determined . 
4.1.3.  There was nothing in the condition of the train wheels or the profile of the rail that w ould ha ve 
adversely affected the wheel -to-rail contact patch . 
4.1.4.  The driver of the Melling 2 train tested positive for the presence  of cannabis  metabolites in his 
urine .  The investigation was un able to establish whether his performance on the day was 
impaired by the effect s of cannabis.  However, the use of performance -impairing substances by 
train drivers is a significant safety issue.  
4.1.5.  As the following analysis show s, a factor contributing to ea ch accident was that the train 
braking system did not perform as well as it could have in the low -adhesion conditions.  
4.1.6.  A key safety issue was that the National Rail System Standards (NRSS)  did not require the 
Matangi braking system to be tested under slipp ery track conditions against an appropriate 
standard.  Consequently the train brake system had not been optimised for  low-adhesion 
conditions . 
4.1.7.  The analysis discusses what happened in each case leading up to the collision.   
4.1.8.  Consider ation is also given to : the performance of the train braking system ; driver training in 
respect of  the difference s between the Ganz Mavag and Matangi braking systems ; and the 
management  of risk to trains operating  into terminating stations , which  had not kept pace with 
industry changes.  
4.2. Interpretation of evidence  
Melling 1  
4.2.1.  The driver of the Melling 1 train had braked smoothly down to 47 km/h by the time his train 
reached the start of  the platform .  This was below the maximum  speed of 50 km/h .  When he 
increased the brake demand from 31% to 50% the wheels lost adhesion and began to slide.  
The dynamic brakes in the motor car were the only brakes in use at the time and the traction 
control units attempted to control the wheel slide.  The train was about 52 m from the stop 
block and  it would travel that distance in about six seconds.  
4.2.2.  The driver applied  full service brake , then full pneumatic  brake9, followed by the emergency 
brake.  The c omputer -controlled brake system responded by disabl ing the dynamic brakes .  
Then it increase d the friction brake force on both the motor car and the trailer .  As the friction 
brake force increased, the wheels continued to slide .  The applied brake force was limited by 
the wheel -slide  protection  system  while it attempted  to optimi se the train brak ing force .  The 
train braking system  was unable to apply  an effective brake force  in the time available .  The 
train  collided with the stop block at 0754  at an estimated speed of 25 km/h .   
4.2.3.  The speeds and brake actions are presented graphically in Appendix 1.  
                                                        
9 Applying full pneumatic brake is effectively applying emergency brake.

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 Melling 2  
4.2.4.  The Melling 2 driver started decelerati ng his train 1.2 kilometre s from the Melling Station stop 
block by selecting ' off' with the power/brake  control  lever .  He increased the brake to 23% then 
reduced it to 18% when the train was about 525 m fro m the stop block .  At 430  m out from the 
stop block, the wheels started to slide.  The train was travelling at 58 km/h and the computer -
controlled braking system was using dynamic brakes only.  The traction control units were 
unable to control the wheel slide within three seconds , so the computer -controlled brake 
system disabled the dynamic brakes and increased the friction brake force in the motor car.  
4.2.5.  The driver  had also  realised that the train was not slowing at the rate he expected , so he 
increased br ake demand to 50%, and then to 100%.  The computer -controlled brake system 
responded by increasing the friction brake force in the trailer car to about 75% , which caused 
the trailer car wheels to slide  also.  Four seconds later the driver applied full pneu matic brake , 
followed by emergency brake.   
4.2.6.  After the dynamic brakes were disabled, the wheel -slide  protection  units fluctuated  the 
friction brake  force  in both cars in an attempt  to control the slide  until the train hit  the stop 
block  at an estimated speed of 35 km/h .  The wheel -slide  protection  systems  were  unable to 
regain an effective rate of deceleration over  the last 430 m (see Appendix 1  for distances 
and speeds ).   
 
4.2.7.  The driver of the Melling 2 train test ed positive for cannabis , which  is of concern. The 
Commission has included substance use on its ' watch list' and encourages regulators and 
operators to put measu res in place to prevent substance impairment by persons in safety -
critical roles. It was not possible to determine whether the driver was impaired at the time of 
the accident.    
4.2.8.  Although cannabis impairment reduces with time since exposure it affects people differently 
and is known to impair  the executive cognitive function of informat ion processing .  Other 
executive functions affected are planning, decision -making, risk taking, and working memory.   
All of these functions are crucial for a train driver to operat e safely (see Appendix 5 for more 
details).  
Conditions common to both accid ents 
4.2.9.  Both drivers were handling their trains in a normal way.  They approached Melling Station within 
the speed limit for the line and they were on target to reduce the train speed to less than 50 
km/h by the time they reached the start of the platform.   
4.2.10.  Both drivers said that they had been  alert and focused upon the task and not distracted.  They 
had had light duty schedules with adequate periods of rest  in the days leading up to their 
respective accidents .  Cell phone records proved that the drivers were  not engaged in text or 
voice communications at the time.  Therefore , fatigue and distraction were very unlikely to have 
been factor s in either accident.   
4.2.11.  The train event recorders  showed that the train wheel -slide  protection system activated  in both 
accidents , meaning  that low adhesion was a common factor.  
4.2.12.  Both trains were repaired sufficiently for the brakes to be tested on the track.  Repairs were 
limited to facilitate a safe test run but all brake equipment and brake -controller software were  
kept as they originally were  during the accidents.  Test runs were conducted by KiwiRail 
engineers on dry track around the Wellington rail network, with a Commission observer on 
board.  Several brake test runs from a steady speed to a full stop were a lso conducted using 
various combinations of brake selection, pneumatic brake and emergency brake.   
4.2.13.  These test runs proved that the train brake s were  working on both trains at the time of the 
accidents , and that each train conformed to the NRSS standard fo r stopping distances on dry 
track.  
  
Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 
<< Page 15 >>
 4.2.14.  The Commission engaged MetService to analyse data on the weather conditions preceding both 
accidents.  They concluded that in both cases dew was likely to have formed on the track and 
that the weather conditions preceding  each accident had been dry for several days.  These were 
the ideal circumstances for low -adhesion conditions to exist.  
4.2.15.  Several dry days preceding the accident s would have allowed a layer of natural deposits to form 
on the top of the rail , which was then f ollowed by the formation of dew.  The resulting mixture 
would have created a low -adhesion layer between the rail and the train wheels . 
4.3. Management of infrastructure risk at terminating stations  
The line speed limit  
4.3.1.  The maximum line speed for approaching  Melling Station was 70 km/h. Drivers were taught to 
aim to have the ir train speed s at below 50 km/h  by the time the train s reache d the beginning of 
the platform.  The line speed is set dependin g on the geometry of the track.  From a risk 
perspective, Mell ing is a terminating station, meaning the consequences of overrunning the 
platform are much higher than at non-terminating stations.  The same applies to the target 
speed for when the train reaches the start of the platform.  Any train malfunction , low tra ck 
adhesion  or underperformance of the train braking system risks the train colliding with the stop 
block.  
4.3.2.  The Commission recommended that KiwiRail reassess the speed limit for trains approaching 
Melling Station, and that it also reassess the speed limit f or trains approaching other 
terminating stations on the rail network.  KiwiRail has since accepted these recommendations 
and addressed the safety issue.  
The stop block  
4.3.3.  The concrete stop block had been  installed in  1954.  It lacked the impact -absorbing qual ities of 
more modern stop blocks.  The less effective they are, the greater the damage to the train and 
its occupants, as both these collisions demonstrated.   The Commission recommended that 
KiwiRail replace the concrete stop block with a more appropriate shock -absorbing system 
similar to the type being installed in Auckland at the time.  KiwiRail accepted this 
recommendation and replaced the stop block.  
The overhead power  
4.3.4.  There were two issues with the overhead traction power system .  Firstly, the terminal pole was 
hit by the Melling 2 train because it was directly in the path of the train when it collided with and 
overran  the stop block.  The force of the collision severed the pole, causing the live overhead 
wire to dro op and contact the train.   
4.3.5.  The Commission recommended that KiwiRail relocate the terminal pole out of line with a direct 
overrun.  This has since been completed with a new cantilevered pole mounted off to one side 
of the rail centreline and the safety reco mmendation  has been  closed.  
4.3.6.  When the contact wire dro oped and touched the train, it tripped the electrical protection 
system, which led to t he second issue .  The traction controller at the Wellington National Train 
Control Centre reset the power before the  driver was able to warn train control of the accident.  
The Commission raised with KiwiRail the risk of promptly resetting the overhead power  without 
first establishing the reason for the system tripping . 
4.3.7.  After two further incidents KiwiRail submitted to the Commission in December 2014 that it had 
accepted its concerns about promptly resetting the overhead power after a protection trip .  
KiwiRail then  issued an internal memo to change its operating procedures.  Based on this 
action the Commission did not i ssue a safety recommendation.

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 4.4. Train brake performance  
Brake performance expectations  
4.4.1.  Appendix 2 demonstrates the best theoretical stopping  distance for a Matangi train in low -
adhesion conditions .  It assumes that  the wheel -slide protection system s operate perfectly to 
control the wheel creep and allow the maximum brake effort to be applied in the  conditions.  
The calculation shows that a  train with a typical passenger load for Melling could  decelerate at 
0.49 m/ s2 to stop in 197 m from 50 km/h  using full service brake  in low -adhesion conditions 
(at 5%) .   
4.4.2.  In the Melling 2 accident (see details in Appendix 1) the train managed to decelerate at 0.3 
m/s2 over the first 251 m, reducing to 0.015 m/s2 over the remaining 179 m , and only slow by 
23 km/h  but not stop in the total distance of 430 m.  This comparison between theoretical and 
actual brake performance indicated that either the adhesion was much less than 5% or there 
was a performance issue with the train brakes in low -adhesion conditions , or that there was a 
combination of both factors . 
4.4.3.  The train commissioning tests conducted by the manufacturer established that the train braking 
system performed to the GWRC procurement specification .  These tests  included extensive test 
runs with various c ombinations of brake application and some with simulated low -adhesion 
conditions.  The overall  requirement was that the train complied with NRSS /6 - Engineering 
Interoperability  Standard , Version 1 ( NRSS/6 ) to stop within 460 m from a speed of 100 km/h 
in all normal climatic conditions.   Testing proved that the train met  the NRSS /6 stopping 
distance requirements.   
4.4.4.  The commissioning test specification did not require the train braking and  wheel -slide  
protection systems to be tested in controlled low-adhesio n condition s in accordance with  an 
internationally recognised standard10, nor was it required by any other authority .   
4.4.5.  To investigate  the performance of the brake system , GWRC agreed to conduct a series of brake 
tests in low-adhesion  conditions and measure the performance of the Matangi brake system.  
Low-adhesion brake test  program me 
4.4.6.  The tests  proved that in low-adhesion  conditions the current configuration of the computer -
controlled brake system did not perform as well as it could ha ve.  Several opportunities for 
improving the train brake performance were identified and trialled. These include d:  
                                                        
10 For example, UIC 541 -05. Finding s 
1. It is very likely that for both collisions with the stop block at Melling Station , an extended 
period of dry weather combined with the formation of dew on the rail resulted in a 
condition of low rail adhesion along the approach to the station.  
2. It was not possible to determine whether the driver of the Melling 2 train was impaired by 
cannabis.  However, the fact that he had cannabis in his system is a serious safety issue.  
3. Both trains were travelling at a normal speed of approach to Melling Station and both 
drivers applied a normal braking technique during the approach.  
4. The operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform at 
Melling Station and colliding with the stop block had not been adequately considered.  No 
special speed restriction for the approach had been set; the stop block was an older and 
less effective design  than its modern equivalent ; and the pole carrying the overhead 
traction power line was placed directly behind the stop  block where it was prone to 
damage.

  reducing  the initial amount of available dynamic brake effort  
 reducing subsequent available dynamic brake effort after each wheel -slide cont rol 
attempt  
 improving the trailer car friction brake behaviour during wheel slide with dynamic brakes  
 optimising the wheel -slide control in the motor car  
 improving the handover between dynamic and friction brake controllers  
 improving the interaction of au tomatic brakes with the manual pneumatic brakes .  
The system was reconfigured  and further trials were conducted.     
4.4.7.  As a result of the test programme, GWRC initiate d corrective actions  to improve the low-
adhesion  brake performance  and approved software changes.  The first software upgrade was  
rolled out across the Matangi fleet in 2015 . 
4.4.8.  The test programme raised  a further concern  that t he wheel -slide  protection  system for the 
friction brakes was not performing in accordance with the UIC 541 -05 standard11.  GWRC 
arranged for the brake manufacturer to conduct a more rigorous test of the wheel -slide 
protection units in a test facility in Italy. This resulted in a  further software u pgrade to improve 
the performance of the friction brake wheel -slide  protecti on system in low-adhesion  conditions.  
This software upgrade was  rolled out across the fleet in mid-2016 .   
4.4.9.  Following the testing program me and the software changes to the train brake system , the 
Matangi train brake performance in low-adhesion  conditions was noticeably improved.   
4.4.10.  However, t here are too many variables, unknowns and possible scenarios to draw any definitive 
conclusions on whether the trains would have stopped before the stop blocks if these 
improvements had been made when the trains were commissioned .  For example:  
 the dew suspected of causing the low adhesion evaporated soon after the events , so the 
extent and level of low adhesion could not be measured  
 the method of measuring low adhesion is subject to variability and the result may diff er 
from the actual adhesion experienced by a train  
 the control inputs from the drivers could vary depending upon circumstances at the 
time, such as : their choice  of speed and brake selections ; their knowledge about how 
the brakes worked ; and the response they had  each experienced with the brakes  during  
the accidents . 
New Zealand standards for train brakes  
4.4.11.  It is concerning that t he brake performance of a new and modern commuter train  was only 
made to comply with the basic requirements of NRSS /6.  The standard is silent on: low-
adhesion  brake performance; wheel -slide  prevention systems; full train brake performance 
across different braking systems; and reference to appropriate international standards.  
4.4.12.  Although the selected train brake equipment ha d the capability to perform well in low-adhesion  
conditions, the brake performance specification s did not require it to be verified. Therefore , the 
system was not set up for optimum performance.  The current trend in Europe  is to test train 
brakes to local  standards12, with a complete train as a fully integrated brake system .  These 
standards include the verification of wheel -slide  protection systems  in controlled low-adhesion  
conditions  and the optimal integration of dynamic and friction brakes . 
4.4.13.  The NRSS  was originally intended to provide an interoperability framework for rail participants 
to meet when wishing to operate on the rail network. It is still the only formal set of rail 
standards available in New Zealand.

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 4.4.14.  In 2010 t he Commission issued three safet y recommendations to the Secretary for Transport to 
address safety issues relating to th e status of the NRSS.  As a result of the Melling accidents 
the Commission  issued a new recommendation to the NZ Transport Agency in 2015 to review 
the NRSS to ensure that low-adhesion  braking requirements were incorporated into the 
standards and that they were applicable to all trains intended to operate on the National Rail 
System.  The Co mmission now has a total of seven open safety recommendations targeting 
changes to the NRSS.  Three are to the Secretary of Transport and f our to the N Z Transport 
Agency.  
4.4.15.  The N Z Transport Agency is currently addressing these recommendations by undertaking an 
independent review to establish an appropriate rail regulatory framework for the future.   In light 
of this review the Commission makes no new recommendations on this safety issue.   
4.5. Driver trainin g 
4.5.1.  The Matangi driver conversion training suggested that  drivers  consider  the computer -controlled  
brake system as a 'black box' that performed  better than the braking system in the older Ganz -
Mavag  train s.  This suggestion was reinforced to the drivers when they experienced the Matangi  
train's  effective brakes on dry track.  
4.5.2.  Critical information describing  how the computer -controlled  brake system operated was not 
provided in the conversion course material  or in the Train Crew Manual.   Several drivers were 
interviewed about their understanding of  how the computer -controlled  braking system worked.  
It became evident that t he conversion training had not adequately inform ed drivers about the 
differences between the two braking systems, particularly in low-adhesion  conditions , and how 
the brake effort  is shared between the motor car and trailer . 
4.5.3.  A key difference was the Matangi's preference for using dynamic brakes.  This reduced the 
number of braked wheels to just those wheels on the motor car and consequently it required a 
higher level of adhesion to deliver that brake force.  The effect was that the Matangi would 
experience wheel slide more often t han the Ganz -Mavag in low-adhesion  conditions. (See 
Appendix 3 for more details .) 
4.5.4.  Another key difference between these two train brake systems was how brake effort was shared 
between the motor car and trailer.  The Matangi computer -controlled  brake system applied all 
brake effort from the motor car before using the trailer car brakes.  The Ganz -Mavag stepped 
the brake effort sequentially in thirds.  The first step would apply one-third  brake force from the 
motor car , the next step would add one-third  to the  trailer, the next would increase the motor 
car to two-thirds  and so on until full service brake had been reached on each car.  
4.5.5.  In a four-year period , drivers encountered various brak ing problems with the newly 
commissioned trains , including dynamic brakes tripping out  and their being unable to stop the 
train s at target point s.  The problems  sometimes resulted in platform overruns , which were 
subsequently reported to the regulator and the operator but little progress was made in 
resolving the m.  This led to drivers losing confidence in the braking system and to experiment  
with alternative braking techniques or work -around actions.  
4.5.6.  The operator did not have a best practice  of braking in an emergency , so had left it to the 
drivers ' discretion.  A benefit of the brake  test program me was drivers actually experiencing  
wheel -slide  protection  activity while braking on a safe and controlled low-adhesion  test track .  
The operator was subsequently able to define a best -practice braking technique for low-
adhesion  conditions and  retrain  its drivers  accordingly .   
4.6. Subsequent events  and preventive measures  
4.6.1.  On 10 June 2015 at 1039 , a third Matangi train13 had a braking problem at Melling in low -
adhesion conditions.  The Commission made enquiries into the in cident and reviewed the train

<< Page 19 >>
 data logger record.  The train had been upgraded with the new brake control software and the 
driver was aware of the new, best -practice , low-adhesion braking technique.   
4.6.2.  The train started to slide near the 'on -tracking boards ' at the start of the straight into Melling 
Station , but the driver recognised the wheel -slide protection activity and applied emergency 
brakes.  The train was reported to have come to a stop from 35 km/h in 205 m , which 
represents a deceleration rate of a pproximately 0.23 m/s2.  The point where it stopped was 
before the platform , so the driver then crept the train forward to the desired target stop point , 
where it was stopped normally.   
4.6.3.  GWRC arranged for the wheel -slide activity to be presented to the driver's  screen of the train 
management system.  This will help drivers to recognise when low -adhesion conditions exist 
and to implement their defensive driving techniques.  
4.6.4.  GWRC took the initiative to organise a 'Low -adhesion working group' in the Wellington area. The 
group has members from all aspects of the rail industry , including the train operator, network 
manager and infrastructure owner.  The working group's purpose is to share information about 
low-adhesion conditions and collaboratively take action to  reduce its effect on operations in the 
Wellington rail network.  
4.6.5.  In October 2016 GWRC started the purchasing process for a Matangi train simulator to assist 
with future driver training.  Depending on the fidelity of the simulator controls, it could provid e a 
means to better prepare drivers for handling low -adhesion conditions.   
  Finding s 
5. The Matangi braking and wheel -slide  protection systems were not performing as well as 
they could have  because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and 
tuned for optimum  braking in low-adhesion  conditions before the trains were 
commissioned to service.  
6. It could not be established whether either collision would have been prevented had the 
brake and wheel -slide  protection systems been operating to their optimum in  low-adhesion  
conditions . 
7. The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in 
low-adhesion  conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with 
computer -controlled  brake and wheel -slide  prote ction systems.  
8. The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi 
train type did not provide them  with sufficient information in respect of the design and 
correct operation of the train brake and wheel -slide  protection systems.  
 

<< Page 20 >>
 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 5. Findings  
5.1. It is very likely that for both collisions with the stop block at Melling Station, an extended period 
of dry weather combined with the formation of dew on the rail resulted in a condition of low rail 
adhesion along the approach to the station.  
5.2. It was not possible to determine whether the driver of the Melling 2 train was impaired by 
cannabis.  However, the fact that he had cannabis in his system is a serious safety issue.  
5.3. Both trains were travelling at a no rmal speed of approach to Melling Station and both drivers 
applied a normal braking technique during the approach.  
5.4. The operating risk and potential consequences of a train overrunning the platform at Melling 
Station and colliding with the stop block h ad not been adequately considered.  No special speed 
restriction for the approach had been set; the stop block was an older and less effective design 
than its modern equivalent; and the pole carrying the overhead traction power line was placed 
directly beh ind the stop block where it was prone to damage.   
5.5. The Matangi braking and wheel -slide protection systems were not performing as well as they 
could have because they had not been tested against an appropriate standard and tuned for 
optimum braking in low -adhesion conditions before the trains were commissioned to service.  
5.6. It could not be established whether either collision would have been prevented had the brake 
and wheel -slide protection systems been operating to their opt imum in low -adhesi on conditions . 
5.7. The National Rail System Standards do not adequately address the braking performance in low -
adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer -
controlled brake and wheel -slide protection systems.  
5.8. The training that drivers received for transitioning from the Ganz Mavag to the Matangi train 
type did not provide them with sufficient information in respect of the design and correct 
operation of the train brake and wheel -slide protection systems.

 6. Safety a ctions  
6.1. General  
6.1.1.  The Commission classifies  safety actions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
6.2. Safety a ctions  address ing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2.1.  GWRC conducted full train brake tests in sustained low-adhesion  conditions then followed up 
with corrective actions.  This resulted in the upgrade of the computer -controlled  brake system to 
ensure that train s would stop in the shortest possible distance in low-adhesion  conditions.   The 
software upgrades were rolled out across the fleet during  a long weekend in early 2015.   This 
included an indicator to drivers when wheel -slide protection activity was taking pla ce.  Further 
upgrades to the wheel -slide  protection  systems were completed mid-2016.  
6.2.2.  KiwiRail retrained the Wellington metro train drivers to better inform them about how the 
Matangi computer -controlled  brakes worked and provided a best -practice braking technique in 
low-adhesion  conditions. All drivers went through a retraining module before the new software 
was rolled out.  
6.2.3.  KiwiRail changed the network control operating procedures to ensure that whenever the 
overhead power to a rail line tripped out the controllers would not reset the power before a 
thorough and reasonable check to ensure that any trains in the area would not be put at undue 
risk of electric shock.  
6.2.4.  GWRC set up and organised a cross -organisation 'Low adhesion working group'  for the 
Wellington area , which r epresentatives from the owner, train maintenance, train operator, 
networks owner and train control  attend .  The group meets regularly to focus  jointly  on 
mitigating the risk s of operating trains in low-adhesion  conditions a round the Wellington 
network and to share information that is of use to the group.  
6.2.5.  GWRC has approved the procurement of a d river simulator for the Matangi to commence in 
October 2016.  
6.3. Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.3.1.  None identified

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 7. Recommendations  
7.1. General  
7.1.1.  The Commission may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to  KiwiRail and the NZ Transport 
Agency.  N otice of the recommendations to the NZ Transport Agency was also given to  CAF New 
Zealand L imited , Auckland Transport and Transdev Auckland . 
7.1.2.  In the interests of transport safety,  it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the future.  
7.2. Recommendations to KiwiRail  
Speed restrictions for terminal stations  
7.2.1.  Two trains have collided with the stop bl ock at Melling Station in the space of just over one year.  
The normal line speed for the section of track between the preceding station and Melling is 70 
km/h.  The Melling Station platform only becomes clearly visible to a train driver once the ir train 
has rounded the last bend, about 400 m from the stop block.  If trains were restricted to a lower 
speed before they rounded the last bend, the risk of a platform overrun and resulting collision 
with the stop block would be reduced.  
7.2.2.  On 30 June 2014  the Commi ssion recommended that KiwiRail apply a suitable permanent 
speed restriction to the last section of the Melling Line to reduce the approach speed to Melling 
Station. (018/14 ) 
7.2.3.  On 8 July 2014 the General Manager - Rail Passenger Group advised that KiwiRail h ad reduced 
the 'line speed ' on the Melling Line from 70 km/h to 50 km/h and imposed a speed restriction 
of 25 km/h for the approach to Melling Station.  
7.2.4.  On 26 March 2015 the Commission approved the closure of the recommendation on the basis 
that the actions taken by KiwiRail had address ed the safety issue.  
7.2.5.  On 30 June 2014  the Commission recommended  that KiwiRail assess all other terminating 
stations on the controlled network throughout New Zealand and similarly apply permanent 
speed restrictions as ne cessary to the approaches at those stations. (019/14 ) 
7.2.6.  On 8 July 2014 the General Manager - Rail Passenger Group advised that KiwiRail had :  
Completed a risk assessment for all lines in the metro Wellington region that 
have no over -run (end of line) with st op blocks to establish that the controls in 
place are appropriate for managing approach speeds and distances to the stop 
blocks in the event that there is a similar [occurrence] caused by lack of braking 
action, and that any resultant impact damage would b e adequately contained.   
As a result of the risk assessment, "a 25 km/h speed restriction has been placed 
on the Johnsonville Line, similar to that which has been introduced for the 
Melling Line".  
7.2.7.  On 23 September 2015 the Commission approved  the closure of  the recommendation on the 
basis that the actions taken by KiwiRail had address ed the safety issue . 
 Stop block  
7.2.8.  The stop block installed at Melling was a solid concrete block with a limited ability to absorb 
impact forces. It was physically shifted in the first collision, and even further in the second. The 
second impact also split the concrete block near ground level and allowed it to rotate backward 
under the train.  The train rode up and over the stop block as a consequence, sustaining 
substantial damage . 
  
Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 
<< Page 23 >>
 7.2.9.  Modern shock -absorbing stop blocks used on other terminating train stations on the controlled 
network reduce the consequences in terms of injury to persons and damage to trains if 
overruns should occur that lead to trains striking the stop blocks.  
7.2.10.  On 30 June 2014 the Commission recommended  that KiwiRail replace the type of stop block 
that was in use at Melling with a new shock -absorbing type design that would be matched to the 
likely impact forces from a Matangi train. (020/14 ) 
7.2.11.  On 21 July 2014 the General Manager - Rail Passenger Group replied:  
KiwiRail advises its engineering team is currently in the design phase for the 
replacement stop block. It is most likely the replacement will be of the "friction 
retarder" type as used at  Britoma rt Transport Centre, Manu kau Station and 
Onehunga Station. Key design inputs are the train loading, design impact speed 
and available retarding track length (which could impact on the usable platform 
length ). A similar analysis is being undertaken on the Johnsonville Line buffer 
stop.  
7.2.12.  On 23 June  2016 the Commission approved the closure of the recommendation on the basis 
that the actions taken by KiwiRail had address ed the safety issue.  
The overhead traction terminal pole  
7.2.13.  The stop block at Melling w as mounted directly in front of the terminal (last) pole supporting the 
high-voltage overhead contact wire for the electric trains.  At the  collision in 2013 the support 
structure was damaged, and in the 2014 event the pole was snapped off at ground level,  
causing the overhead contact wire to dro op onto the body of the train.  The fallen high -voltage 
line created a risk to the train occupants and delayed the evacuation of the train after it came 
to rest.  
7.2.14.  Placing the power pole directly in line with the stop  block was a safety issue that increased the 
potential consequences of a train overrunning the station platform and striking the stop block.  
7.2.15.  On 30 June 2014  the Commission recommended  that KiwiRail relocate the terminal pole for 
the overhead line at Mellin g Station to be clear of the potential train overrun path. (021/14 ) 
7.2.16.  On 21 July 2014 the General Manager - Rail Passenger Group replied:  
KiwiRail advised  that as part of the "friction retarder" type buffer solution being 
implemented in response to recommen dation 020/14, a design for an offset 
pull-off pole is being prepared. This will remove the terminal pole from track 
centre and relocate to a location where it would not be foul of a railed train. It is 
expected that his design will also be considered for the terminal pole at 
Johnsonville Station.  
7.2.17.  On 16 December 2015  the Commission approved  the closure of  the recommendation on the 
basis that the actions taken by KiwiRail had address ed the safety issue.

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 7.3. Recommendations  to NZ Transport Agency  
Rail standards for new trains  
7.3.1.  The National Rail System Standard 6  - Engineering and Interoperability  (NRSS/6)  is the only 
standard within the National Rail System set that defines braking performance. However, it 
does not address the performance in low-adhesion  conditions of modern metropolitan 
passenger trains that are fitted with computer -controlled  brake and wheel -slide  protection 
systems. The current NRSS/ 6 does not require any more from a braking system than that a 
train is able to stop within a specified di stance in normal climatic  conditions  and with a 
maximum adhesion of 12% .  
7.3.2.  The regulator for the country of operation or the owner may define what adhesion conditions 
might be encountered on a rail network and what level of braking performance is expected f rom 
a new train and what standards the train is to be tested to for compliance. This is also the stage 
in commissioning a new train when the interaction s between all of the brake systems are 
adjusted to achieve the optimum overall brake performance.  The R ail Safety and Standards 
Board in the UK has produced a guidance note (GM/GN2695) to achieve this purpose in the UK 
but nothing similar exists for New Zealand.  
7.3.3.  The Matangi train brake systems were tested for compliance and proper operation, but they 
were n ot tested and adjusted for optimum brake performance in low-adhesion  conditions.  The 
Commission considers that the occurrences in Wellington may be repeated unless the NRSS is  
revised.  
7.3.4.  As a minimum the Commission considers that the NRSS  should call upon appropriate 
international standards to formalise new train type testing and ensure that train braking 
systems are tested in low-adhesion  conditions and optimised for the train s.  
7.3.5.  On 26 March 2015  the Commission recommend ed that the Chief E xecutive of the N Z Transport 
Agency require a full review of the NRSS , and in particular NRSS/ 6, to ensure that low-adhesion  
braking requirements are defined in the standards and made applicable for all trains intended 
to operate on the National Rail Syste m. (005/15)  
7.3.6.  On 11 May 2015  the Chief Executive of the N Z Transport Agency responded : 
While the Transport Agency cannot 'require' a full review of the National Rail 
System Standards (NRSS), it is the Transport Agency's intention to work with the 
NRSS execut ive to ensure relevant aspects of low adhesion braking capability are 
reflected in the appropriate standard.   
Auckland trains  
7.3.7.  The Commission is aware that new passenger trains have recently been introduced in Auckland.  
The Commission  is not aware of any safety issues with the new trains , but expects  that they 
would have been tested to comply with the same National Rail System standards  as the 
Matangi trains in Wellington. Therefore , they may be exposed to the same lack of optimised 
brake performance risk s in low-adhesion  conditions.   
7.3.8.  On 26 March 2015  the Commission recommended  that the Chief Executive of the N ew Zealand  
Transport Agency review the process followed for the commissioni ng of the Auckland trains, and 
if they have not been optimised for low adhesion  conditions or adhesion management systems 
introduced to reduce the risk of incidents across the network, he address those safety issues in 
line with the safety actions planned for the Matangi train operation  (006/15)  
7.3.9.  On 11 May 2015  the Chief Executive of the N Z Transport Agency responded : 
The Transport Agency has commenced discussions with Auckland Transport and 
CAF regarding this recommendation.

 7.3.10.  On 9 April 2015 the Commission g ave notice of preliminary safety recommendations 00 5/15 
and 006/15 under section 9 of the Transport Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 to 
the following parties:  
 the Depot General Manager, CAF New Zealand Limited  as the manufacturer and maintainer 
of the new Auckland trains  
 the Chief Executive Officer of Auckland Transport as the owner of the new Auckland trains  
 the Managing Director of Transdev Auckland as the operator of the new Auckland trains.

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 8. Key l essons  
8.1 Slippery track condition s are a foreseeable risk and t rain braking systems  must be designed, 
tested and optimised  to provide adequate braking performance under those conditions.  
8.2 Train drivers must be adequately  trained to be fully conversant  with the characteristics of their 
train brakin g system s, and to drive their trains within the trains ' capabilit ies. 
8.3 When a new train type is being c ommissioned and first entered into service, t rain operators 
should seek feedback from the drivers on train  perform ance  in order to identify and  remedy  
promptly  any potential performance  issues.

    Fn  = (34  t + 41.5  t) x 9.81  m/s2  = 760.6 kN  
Therefore the normal force p er wheel:  = Fn/(8 x 2)    = 46.3 kN  
 Assume that all wheels are braked evenly and total required decelerating force is 68 kN  
Therefore the required brake force (Fa) per braked wheel is 68 kN/(8 x2)  = 4.25 kN  
As the friction coefficient 𝜇= 𝐹𝑎
𝐹𝑛, the min imum required friction coefficient needed  to apply this braking 
force without causing wheel slide is: 
      4.25/46.3 = 0.091  =  9% 
 
Motor car braking only  
If all braking must be provided by the motor car, the required deceleration force to slow the train 
remains the same but it must be applied through fewer wheels , so the minimum required friction 
coefficient will increase.  
The motor car normal force:   = 41.5  t x 9.81 m/s2   = 407 kN  
Therefore the normal force per wheel:  = 407  kN/(4 x 2)  = 50.9 kN  
The required brake force to stop the train is the same but it is shared across fewer wheels. The brake 
force per wheel:    = 68 kN/(4 x 2)    = 8.5 kN  
The minimum required friction coefficient is now:  
       8.5/50.9 = 0.16  =  16%  
 
Conclusion  
When the computer -controlled brake system applies only dynamic brakes to slow the train, a greater 
level of adhesion  is required  to achieve the selected deceleration rate than would  be required  if the 
brake effort were  spread across  the motor car and trai ler car.  
If this minimum required adhesion is not available, the motor car wheels will start to slide.

 Appendix 4: Research on r ail adhesion  
A.1 The rolling contact surface area between the wheel tread and the top of the rail head plays a 
critical part in the operation of all railway systems.  This contact area is called the 'contact 
patch'.  If the friction  of this contact patch is too low , the wheels will lose adhesion and slip 
when the train accelerates or slide when it brake s.     
A.2 The rolling  contact patch is oval shaped and typically about 100 square millimetres  in area .  For 
a driven or braked wheel it consists of two regions called the 'stick' and the ' slide ' regions 
(Olofsson & Lewis, 2006) .  These regions vary depending on the applied traction or braking 
force.  When a train is coasting , with no power or braking, the whole contact patch area is 
'stick '.  When brake force is applied the surface speed of the wheel moves slightly slower than 
the speed  at which  the train is moving over the rail .  This rolling friction causes the stick region 
of the contact patch to reduce  with a consequential increase in the slide  region .

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 A.3 The forces relevant to slowing a train are demonstrated in Figure 10 .  The train velocity is shown 
as the vector (v)  and the rotational velocity of the wheel tread as ωr (pronounced omega -r).  The 
difference between these two velocities is called ' creep ' and it is usually expressed as a 
percentage of the rail vehicle velocity . 
A.4 Adhesion force (Fa) is the transmitted tangential force in the longitudinal direction between the 
railway wheel and the rail.  It can be used to describe both the accelerating and the  braking 
force applied to a rail vehicle.  Adhesion is dependent upon the coefficient of friction between 
the two surfaces in contact and related by the formula:  
𝜇= 𝐹𝑎
𝐹𝑛 
[Where µ = Coefficient of friction (often expressed as a percentage), Fa = maximum adhesion 
force at the point of slide, and Fn = the  Normal14 reaction force due to the weight of the 
vehicle .] 
A.5 The friction ratio will change as the brake force increases due to the dynamics of the 'stick' and 
'slide' regions of the contact patch   The friction ratio will increase sharply to a peak at aroun d 
2% creep, then decrease at a slower rate as the applied brake force and creep continue to 
increase (see Figure 11).  The peak of this curve represents the coefficient of friction at the 
point of slide and the maximum available adhesion.  The slope beyond  the peak is the desired 
control range of wheel creep that wheel slide protection systems use.  If the wheel creep is 
allowed to increase too far by applying more brake force, the 'stick' region of the contact patch 
will reach a point where it is unable to  absorb any further increase in brake force and the wheel 
will lock up and slide along the rail.

Low adhesion  
A.6 The coefficient of friction  between a rail vehicle's wheel tread and a dry rail is normally between 
12% and 40%.  Low adhesion is defined as when the coefficient of friction is at 10% or less. 
Very low adhesion is a subset of low adhesion when the adhesion level is less than 5% .  When 
the interface is contaminated by a third body the coefficient of friction may change for the better 
or worse.  Often rail operators inject sand into the contact patch area to increase adhesion or 
natural contaminants may collect on the rail head that reduce adhesion.   
 
A.7 A North American research project conducted by the Transit Cooperative Research Program 
found that low -adhesion conditions occurred in light drizzle, in the early mornings and on icy, 
frosty rails.  The research survey of 24 light rail and commuter rail transit agencies in North 
America was intended to gain a better understanding of the wheel -to-rail adhesi on in the 
presence of natural contaminants . The results are summarised in its digest (TCRP, 1997) .

 Final report RO -2013 -103 and RO -2014 -103 A.8 A chemical analysis of rail head contaminants conducted by British Rail and the Association of 
American Railroads showed that th e rail head is normally covered with a thin film of active oils, 
grease and solid debris.  It found that the oils contained large organic molecules, acid ester, 
ketone, amines and sulphur -containing compounds.  The solid debris was oxides of iron and 
other  locally found components such as dirt and brake dust.  These combined to form a surface 
film that could not  be removed chemically or by scrubbing.  With the addition of small amounts 
of water the film form ed a slurry or paste that reduced adhesion.  The r esearch project 
concluded that "moisture, even in small amounts, on the surface of the rail is the single most 
important contaminant responsible for low adhesion".  
A.9 Beagley et al (cited in Zhu, 2013)  published several papers in the Wear journal in 1975 that 
described research into adhesion between the wheel -rail contact and the effect s of 
contaminants of water, oil and wear debris.  Beagley found that a small amount of water mixed 
with substantial quan tities of debris could form a paste that significantly reduced adhesion. The 
paste was squeezed aside if the water was sufficient.  Zhu's research also confirmed findings by 
several other researchers cited in his thesis, that relative humidity (RH) influen ced the friction 
coefficient up to 55 -65% RH but made no further change above that level of humidity. This was 
associated with water molecules forming a boundary lubrication film around the natural 
contaminants on the rail head.   
A.10 The Rail Safety and Stand ards Board in the UK carried out a review of available research into 
low adhesion in 2004.  It found that low adhesion could not be attributed to a single cause , but 
the most widespread effect noted was that of dew or newly falling rain on rails covered in  tiny 
particles of oil or debris.  On a visibly rusty rail the film formed by the rust debris and water 
molecules can support the wheel completely, and extremely low adhesion can result.  With more 
consistent rainfall, the viscosity of the film is so low  that it is readily squeezed aside , returning 
the adhesion to a higher level (RSSB, 2004) .

 Appendix 5: Research on c annabis impairment  
A.1 There are several paths for a person to ingest cannabis , with variable concentrations of dosage 
that, when combined with the variations in the human body shape, size and internal efficiency , 
result in a range of reactions.   
A.2 Once absorbed into the body, the THC15 and other cannabinoids are rapidly distributed to all  
other tissues at rates dependent on the blood flow. Because they are extremely lipid soluble, 
cannabinoids accumulate in the fatty tissues, reaching peak concentrations in four or five  days.  
After ingestion cannabinoids  are metabolised in the liver then slowly released back into the 
body compartments, including the brain. More than 20 metabolites are known, of which some 
are psychoactive and one (11 -hydroxy -THC) may be more potent than THC.  Metabolites are 
partly excreted in the urine but mainly into the  gut, where they are reabsorbed, further 
prolonging their actions.  Consequently, there is a very poor relationship between the plasma or 
urine concentration and the degree of cannabinoid -induced intoxication (Ashton, 2001) .   
A.3 The d etection of cannabinoids in urine is indicative of prior cannabis exposure , but the long 
excretion half -life of cannabis acid in the body, especially in chronic users, makes it difficult to 
predict the timing of past drug use.  A positive urine test d oes not provide information on the 
route of administration, the amount of drug exposure, when drug exposure occurred, or the 
degree of impairment (Huestis, 2007) . 
A.4 A 2011 literature review of research into the effects of cannabis  use on the executive cognitive 
functions found that it impaired information processing , which is a building block for attention 
and concentration.  Other executive functions affected were planning, decision -making, risk 
taking, inhibition, impulsivity and  working memory.  The review found that recently abstinent 
users (7 hours to 20 days) may or may not continue to experience impairment of attention, 
concentration, inhibition and impulsivity during the interval associated with the elimination of 
THC and it s metabolites from the brain.  Decision -making and risk -taking capabilities had not 
been thoroughly studied at the time but one study cited in the review suggested that these 
abilities were also impaired for an extended period after exposure (Crean et al, 2011) .
