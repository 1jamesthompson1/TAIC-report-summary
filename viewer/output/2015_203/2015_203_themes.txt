Themes/causes present in the report:
1. Flooding of the fish hold: The main cause of the sinking was the flooding of the fish hold, which resulted in reduced stability and potential capsizing of the vessel. This was likely due to water from a deck wash hose that had been left running through an open hatch, exceeding the pumping rate of the bilge pump in the fish hold.

2. Inadequate means of escape: The design of the vessel's wheelhouse and accommodation space did not provide sufficient options for crew members to escape in the event of an emergency. The only direct exit from the wheelhouse was through a sliding door onto the main deck, which was covered by a weatherproof shelter. The alternative means of escape through the forecastle and chain locker were not easily accessible and did not meet the intent of the Maritime Rules.

3. Lack of safety measures: The bilge pumping system on the vessel did not have any means of automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level. Additionally, there was no visual indicator in the wheelhouse to alert the crew when the bilge pump was running. These deficiencies in safety measures contributed to the crew's inability to prevent the sinking of the vessel.
