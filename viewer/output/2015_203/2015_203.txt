The Transport Accident Investigation Commission is an independent Crown entity established to 
determine the circumstances and causes of accidents and incidents with a view to avoiding similar 
occurrences in the future.  Accordingly it is inappropriate that reports should be used to assign fault or 
blame or determine liability, since neither the investigation nor the reporting process has been 
undertaken for that purpose.  
 
The Commission may mak e recommendations to improve transport safety.  The cost of implementing 
any recommendation must always be balanced against its benefits.  Such analysis is a matter for the 
regulator and the industry.

About the Transport Accident Investigation Commission  
The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) is a standing commission of inquiry and  
an independent Crown entity responsible for inquiring into maritime, aviation and rail accidents and 
incidents for New Zealand, and  co-ordinating and co -operating with other accident investigation 
organisations overseas .  The principal purpose of its inqu iries is to determine the circumstances and 
causes of occurrence s with a view to avoiding similar occurrences in the future.  Its purpose is not to 
ascribe blame to any person or agency  or to pursue (or to assist an agency to pursue) criminal, civil or 
regulatory action against a person or agency.  The Commission carries out its purpose by informing 
members of the transport sector and the public, both domestically and internationally, of the lessons 
that can be learnt from transport accidents and incidents.

 1. Executive summary  
1.1. The fishing vessel Jubilee  had been fishing in an area southwest of Banks Peninsula for about 
two days.  At 0030 on 18 October  2015 , the Jubilee  ceased fishing for the night and drifted to 
the weather while the crew rested.  The weather conditions were wind from the southwest at 
25 to 30 knots with little significant swell.  
1.2. At 0419 a telephone call wa s made from the Jubilee 's mobile phone to another company 
vessel fishing in the vicinity.  The call was not answered.  
1.3. At 0420 the skipper of the Jubilee  made a radio 'mayday' call2 giving the Jubilee 's location , 
saying that the vessel was taking on water and that they were abandoning the vessel into the 
liferaft.   Akaroa Radio acknowledged the call and relayed it to all other vessels in the vicinity.  
1.4. Search vessels arrived at the location  at dawn and found only a liferaft  that h ad self -deployed, 
an oil sli ck and some flotsam.  Later that day the wreck of the Jubilee  was found by sonar on 
the seabed at the location given in the mayday call.  
1.5. During  the following week divers identified the wreck of the Jubilee  and recovered the bodies 
of all three crew members  from the wheelhouse.  
1.6. Further dives were made to gather evidence for the  investigation.  Attempts to sal vage the 
vessel from the seabed were not successful.  
1.7. The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) found  it was likely that 
flooding of t he Jubilee 's fish hold was the main factor contributing to it s sinking, or capsizing 
and sinking, and that it was about as likely as not that the cause of the fish hold flooding was 
water from a deck wash hose that had been left running through an open hat ch. 
1.8. The Commission also found  that the absence of a bilge high -level alarm for the fish hold and 
the absence of an indicator in the wheelhouse  alerting the crew when the bilge pump was 
running were missing checks in the system that would have alerted the crew and then about 
as likely as not prevented the sinking.  
1.9.  Safety issues  identified included  the following : 
 the means of escape from the Jubilee's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency were 
not well designed and afforded the crew too few options for escaping in the event of 
capsize or sinking   
 although not relevant to this accident, the means of escape from the Jubilee 's 
wheelhouse and accomm odation space may not have met the intent of maritime rules for 
providing escape for crew in the event of fire   
 there is a lack of advice and guidance in the Maritime Rules on what is an acceptable 
standard for surveyors to approve when the Maritime Rules defer to the surveyors ' 
discretion .  
1.10.  The safety actions  taken by the Jubilee 's owner and two recommendations  made to the 
Director of Maritime New Zealand should address these safety issues.  
1.11.  Key lessons arising from this inquiry were : 
 good watchkeeping includes not only looking after the safe navigation of the vessel, but 
also being vigilant to the state of trim and stability of the vessel and any factors that 
could affect either  
                                                        
2 A mayday call is a spoken distress call that indicates immediate assistance is required for a vessel in grave 
and imm inent danger . 

<< Page 2 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -203  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements set out in Maritime Rules, owners and 
designers of vessels should take a risk -based approach to designing and providing 
escape routes from all compartments for all foreseeable emergencies.  
 crews need to assess and pre -plan escape routes from any part of their vessel s for all 
foreseeable em ergency situations.

 2. Conduct of the inquiry  
2.1. On 18 October 2015 the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) was 
advised by Maritime New Zealand of the accident.  A watching brief was kept on developments 
during the day.  What was thought to be the wreck of the Jubilee  was found on the seabed in 
about 40 metres  (m) of water by a sister vessel using its fish -finding echo sounder.  None of 
the crew was found despite an extensive surface search.   
2.2. On 19 October 2015 the Commission opened an in quiry under section 13(1)b of the Transport 
Accident Investigation Commission Act 1990 , and appointed an investigator in charge. Two 
investigators travelled to Christchurch later that day to commence the investigation.  
2.3. The owner and operator of the vessel were interviewed by the investigation team and evidence 
was gathered . 
2.4. Liaison was made with New Zealand Police, the Police dive team and the Royal New Zealand 
Navy (RNZN) dive team.  A decision was made for the RNZN dive team to carry out an 
underwater sea rch to determine if the wreck was the Jubilee  and, if confirmed , carry out a 
search for the missing crew.  
2.5. Between 24 October and 28 October  2015 , after the wreck was identified and surveyed on 
the seabed using a remotely operated vehicle , the RNZN dive tea m dived on the wreck  and 
recovered the bodies of the three crew and videoed items of interest for the Commission.  
2.6. The investigation team continued seeking evidence and interviewing previous crew members, 
including extracting photographs from a badly damage d tablet computer with the help of the 
Australian Transport Safety Bureau.    
2.7. The Commission made the decision to  salvage the Jubilee , carry  out an in -depth examination, 
and test certain items of interest to gain a better understanding of the circumstances that may 
have caused the vessel to founder.   
2.8. Between 15 April and 5 May 2016 salvage experts, observed by the Commission, made 
numerous attempts to salvage the vessel.  The vessel was raised off the seabed and to wed 
closer  inshore , but ultimately the  attempts were unsuccessful in raising the vessel  to the 
surface.   
2.9. On 6 May 2016 a detailed video survey of the vessel was undertaken and certain items of 
interest  were recovered  for further testing.  The items of int erest underwent further testing at 
an engineering workshop under the supervision of the Commission's investigator in charge.  
2.10.  On 22 February 2017  the Commission approved the draft  report to be circulated to interested 
persons for comment . 
2.11.  The draft report w as distributed to ten interested parties on 7 March 2017 , with the closing 
date for receiving submissions as 29 March 2017 .  Five submissions were received that 
included comments and five submitters declined to comment.   
2.12.  The Commission has considered in d etail all submissions made and any changes as a result 
of those submissions have been included in the final report  
2.13.  On 27 April 2017 the Commission approved the report for publication

 3. Factual information  
3.1. Narrative  
3.1.1.  On 16 October 2015 at about 2230, the skipper and the two crew of the fishing vessel Jubilee  
sailed from Lyttelton and headed for the fishing grounds to the south west of Banks Peninsula 
(see Figure 1).   
3.1.2.  The journey to the fishing grounds took five or six hours.  Usually two of the crew would sleep  
while the remaining crew member would  con3 the vessel to the fishing grounds and sleep 
later.   
3.1.3.  On arrival at the fishing grounds the Jubilee  joined another Ocean Fisheries  Limited  vessel, the 
Legacy , and they fished close to each other throughout the day.  The skipper of the Jubilee  
contacted the skipper of the Legacy  and told him that as the fishin g was not good he was 
going to head in toward s the coast and fish for flatfish overnight.   
3.1.4.  On 18 October at about 0030, the skipper of the Jubilee  telephoned the skipper of the Legacy  
and said that he had changed his mind, and instead of fishing for flatf ish he was going to 
"park up for the night".  The skipper on the Legacy  said he was going to continue fishing while 
heading south.   
3.1.5.  At about 0419 someone on board the Jubilee  tried to contact the Legacy  using the vessel's 
mobile telephone ; the call was no t answered.   
3.1.6.  At 0420 the skipper of the Jubilee  issued a distress call on very high frequency (VHF) radio 
channel 16 ( the safety and calling channel) that the Jubilee  was taking on water and the 
vessel was sinking.  This call was immediately answered by A karoa Maritime Radio , which 
requested  information on  the number of persons on board and what assistance was required.  
The skipper of the Jubilee  reiterated the vessel 's position and said that they were "getting off 
and getting in the liferaft now".   
3.1.7.  At 0422 Akaroa Maritime Radio issued a mayday relay call4 on VHF channel 16.  The skipper 
of the Legacy  immediately answered the mayday relay message.  He stated that he thought 
his was the only vessel in the area and that he was approximately 26 nautical mile s away.  He 
was starting to haul  in his net and would be back at the mayday position in about three and a 
half hours.   
3.1.8.  It was dawn before  the Legacy  arrived at  the mayday position, by which time a large container 
vessel had stopped to render assistance.  The Legacy 's crew found the Jubilee 's liferaft that 
had self -deployed, an oil slick, and some flotsam.  There were no survivors inside the liferaft.  
The float free emergency position indicating radio beacon had also self -deployed and the 
signal had been r eceived by the authorities ashore.  Despite an extensive air and sea search , 
none of the crew was found. The Legacy  returned to Akaroa where it landed the liferaft.   
3.1.9.  The wreck of the Jubilee  was discovered on the seabed later the same day by the  Frontier , 
another Ocean Fisheries vessel , using its fish -finding echo sounder.  The wreck was in virtually 
the same position as that given in the mayday call.  The fishing vessels Jubilee , Legacy  and 
Frontier  had all been constructed by Stark Bros Limited of Lyttel ton, New Zealand and were 
owned by wholly owned independent companies of the Stark family.  The vessels were 
operated by Ocean Fisheries , another wholly owned Stark family company.    
3.1.10.  Several days later divers positively identified the wreck , and the bodies of the three crew 
members were recovered from the wheelhouse . 
 
                                                        
3 To con is to have control of the speed and direction of a vessel . 
4 A mayday relay call is a distress relay call made by a vessel or coast radio station when it has heard a 
distress call that has not been acknowledged and is not in a position to render assistance itself .

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 3.2. Weather and sea conditions  
3.2.1.  The New Zealand MetService weather forecast issued at 0316 on 18 October 2015 for the 
Rangitata sea area in which the Jubilee  was fishing was:  
Northerly 30 knots changing southwest 30 knots this morning and easing to 20 
knots for a time this afternoon and early evening. Rough sea easing for a time. 
Southwest swell 3 metres easing for a time. Northeast swell 2 metres developing 
for a time. Fair vi sibility in the odd morning shower.  
3.2.2.  The weather and sea conditions at the time of the foundering were described by the skipper of 
the Legacy  as "offshore wind of about 25 nautical miles per hour [knots ] with very little swell"; 
he opined that there would have been  no problem sleeping on board the vessel.

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 3.3. Vessel information and manning  
3.3.1.  The Jubilee  (Figure 2) was a steel -hulled stern -trawler built by Stark Bros Limited of Lyttelton , 
New Zealand in 2007/2008.  The Jubilee  had an overall length of 16 m , a breadth of 5.6 m 
and a maximum draught of 2.6 m.  It was powered by a single diesel engine developing 257 
kilowatt s driving a single controllable -pitch  propeller housed in a steerable duct.   
3.3.2.  The Jubilee  was owned by Cress y Fishing Limited and operated by Ocean Fisheries.  The 
Jubilee  had received certification under safe ship management through SGS, a safe ship 
management provider and survey company.  The safe ship management  certificate was valid 
from 3 April 2012 until 3 1 March 2016, and certified  the Jubilee  as fit for purpose as a fishing 
vessel on 12 March 2012 to operate within the New Zealand offshore limits (see Appendix 1).  
At the time of the accident the Jubilee  was operating within the inshore fishing limit.   
3.3.3.  The skipper of the Jubilee  had considerable seagoing experience and held a New Zealand 
inshore launchmaster certificate of competency and a New Zealand certificate of competency 
as a Marine Engineer Class 6.   
3.3.4.  Both of the crew members had extensive seagoing  experience on fishing vessels . One of the 
two crew members on board held New Zealand certificates of competency as a qualified 
fishing deckhand and inshore launchmaster.  The other held a New Zealand certificate of 
competency of advanced deckhand fishing - endorsement.   
3.4. Bilge pumping arrangements  
3.4.1.  All watertight compartments, except  permanent oil and water tanks, must be capable of being 
pumped and drained as stated in Maritime Rules Part 40(D).28 (1) and (2) (see Appendix 3 ).   
3.4.2.  The bilge5 pumping arrangem ents on the Jubilee  are shown in Figure  3.  Most of the major 
compartments were connected by piping to a bilge manifold6 in the engine room.  This allowed 
either the engine -driven bilge pump or the electrically driven bilge pump to pump water from a 
compartment and discharge it over the side of the vessel.  A separate hand pump was 
provided that allowed compartments connected to the bilge manifold to be pumped if neither 
the engine -driven pump nor the electric pump was functioning.   
3.4.3.  The fish hold7 was not connected to the bilge manifold but was fitted with an automatic , 
electrically operated submersible bilge pump that discharged the water over the side of the 
vessel through dedicated pipework.   
3.4.4.  In addition to this arrange ment the engine room and the shaft tunnel were fitted with 
automatic , electrically operated submersible bilge pumps connected to their own dedicated 
pipework.  An emergency bilge pump with flexible pipework was thought to have been stowed 
in the aft compar tment , although this could not be confirmed .   
                                                        
5 A bilge is a space at the lowest point of a compartment on a vessel where water collects . 
6 A bilge manifold is where each individual bilge suction line  connects to the bilge pump . Each bilge suction 
line is provided  with a stop  valve at the manifold to enable control of which suction line the pump can draw 
from.   
7 The fish hold is the space on a fishing vessel where the catch is stowed ; this may be refrigerated and/or rely 
on ice loaded into the hold .

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 4. Analysis  
4.1. Introduction  
4.1.1.  The loss of a relatively new fishing vessel and all of its crew in moderate weather conditions is 
unusual and unexpected, more so considering that the crew were all experienced fishermen.  
4.1.2.  For a vessel to sink, or capsize and sink, water must enter the vessel in sufficient quantity that 
it either overcomes the natu ral buoyancy of the vesse l or erodes the vessel's stability to a 
point where it capsizes.  
4.1.3.  The Commission considered several scenarios that could, or had been  known to , cause  the 
loss of a fishing vessel:  
 the trawl net catching on an obstruction while the vessel was fishing  
 the lo ss of the tail -shaft or a leaking stern gland (seal) on the tail -shaft  
 piercing of the vessel's hull due to a collision  with a sub merged or semi -submerged 
object  
 flooding of the engine room  
 flooding of the fish hold . 
4.1.4.  The trawl net could not have been a fa ctor because the vessel was not fishing at the time of 
the a ccident.  D ivers found all of the fishing equipment in a stowed condition.  
4.1.5.  The condition of the propeller shaft seal was also unlikely to have been a factor.  Divers later 
found the propeller and the propeller shaft seal in place  and apparently in normal condition.  It 
is possible for propeller shafts to develop slow leaks.  However, it would have taken a 
substantial leak to cau se the vessel to founder.  A ny water entering the propeller shaft space  
would have activated  a high -level alarm in the wheelhouse and would have been automatically 
pumped overboard via the stand -alone bilge pump located in the shaft tunnel.  
4.1.6.  The remaining three possible scenarios are discussed in the following sections . 
4.1.7.  Also d iscussed are the survivability of the accident and whether the design of the vessel 
contributed to the crew being unable to escape from the sinking vessel.  
4.1.8.  The Commission also identified a non -contributing safety issue with the Jubilee 's compliance 
with the Maritime Rules covering means of escape from compartments in the event of a fire.  
4.2. Circumstances  
4.2.1.  The skipper of the Jubilee  had informed the skipper of the Legacy  by telephone that they  
"were going to park up for the night"8.  Under Maritime Rules Part 22 there is a requirement 
for all vessels when underway9 to maintain a proper l ookout and a safe navigational  watch 
(see Appendix 2).   
4.2.2.  The bodies of all three crew members were found in the wheelhouse.  The skipper and one 
crew member were scant ily clothe d, as though they had been asleep .  Neither was wearing 
footwear.  T he third crew member was fully clothed, including wearing laced footwear.  It is 
about as likely as not that he had been the designated watchkeeper, assuming one had been 
appointed.  It is  likely that the skipper and the other crew member were sleeping as the 
accident sequence unfolded.  
                                                        
8 From interv iews this was considered to mean heave the vessel to or drift, as opposed to anchoring, so that 
some or all the crew could rest.   
9 A vessel that is not made fast to the shore or aground.  
 
Final Report MO -2015 -203 
<< Page 11 >>
 4.2.3.  The designated watchkeeper is tasked with keeping a navigational watch and periodically 
checking on  the general cond ition of the vessel .  This include s moni toring any alarms and 
being alert to any unusual movement of the vessel as it rides  the seas.  
4.2.4.  It was not possible to establish who, if anyone, was awake as the events unfolded.  M obile 
phone records showed that  the phone be longing to the crew member who wa s found fully 
clothed  was connected to  the internet from 0030 until the approximate time the vessel sank .  
This is not evidence that he was actively using the mobile phone, as some mobile applications 
cause phone s to be connected to the internet i n the background.  
4.2.5.  Someone who was asleep or distracted by using a mobile phone would have been  less likely to 
notice any unusual attitude or movement of the vessel as it was taking on water.  
4.2.6.  Something alerted the crew to the developing situation.  This could hav e been an engine or 
high-level bilge alarm, or simply an extreme attitude or motion of the vessel as it took on 
water.  
4.2.7.  At least one person was awake to make an attempted mobile phone call to the sister vessel 
Legacy .  Also, the skipper made a mayday  radio call shortly before the vessel sank . However,  it 
was not possible to establish wh ich, and for how long , crew member s had been awake before 
the vessel sank.  Equally, it was not possible to establish what actions the crew took to remedy 
the situation before  the vessel sank.  This is particularly important when considering the 
possible causes of the sinking, as explained in the following sections.  
4.2.8.  The Jubilee  had five main watertight compartments .  These were the chain locker10, the 
forecastle space11, the engine room, the aft compartment and the fish hold .  The fish hold was 
the only compartment large enough to on its own cause the vessel to sink when flooded  (see 
Figure 2).  
4.2.9.  All the watertight compartments except the  fish hold were connected to the vessel's bilge 
system by piping that led back to the engine  room.  These compartments each had: 
 high-level bilge alarms that activated a light and an alarm in the wheelhouse  
 bilges that could be pumped out by manually opera ted valves connecting  the bilge to 
either an engine -driven pump or an electric pump in  the engine  room  
 the capability of being pumped manually using a hand pump located on the port12 
side of the main deck.   
                                                        
10 A chain locker is a space in the forward part of a ship, usually beneath the bow forward of the collision 
bulkhead , that contains the anchor chain and rope and in small vessels other ropes . 
11 The forecastle space is the forward part of a vessel containing the crew 's sleeping or living quarters . 
12 Port is the left-hand s ide of a vessel when looking forward .

4.3. Possible or probable scenarios leading to the foundering  
Collision with a submerged object  
4.3.1.  Hull damage was unlikely to have been the cause of the sinking.  
4.3.2.  For the hull to be pierced the vessel would have had to have struck or been struck by an 
object with considerable force  and there would have been visual evidence such as a hole, 
scraped paint  or buck ling of the hull plates.   
4.3.3.  The Jubilee  was constructed with a steel hull and the dive survey showed it to be in good 
condition.  As far as could be ascertained , the hull was not damaged in any  way other than:  
 one of the bilge keels had been slightly crushed, most likely when the vessel came to  
rest on the seabed  
 one of the stabiliser s13, on which the vessel was resting, was slightly bent, as was the 
stabiliser's strut . 
4.3.4.  The Jubilee  and the other vessels in the Ocean Fisheries fleet were  fitted with commercial 
satellite tracking system s, TracPlus, by the operator.  The operator usually receive d hourly 
                                                        
13 Stabilisers are fins mounted below the waterline and emerging laterally from the hull to reduce a vessel's 
roll due to wind or waves. They can usually be retracted by some means to allow the vessel to sit alongside a  
wharf.  When extended they are held rigidly at an angle to the hull by the struts that are mounted on the 
vessel's main deck   

 
Final Report MO -2015 -203 
<< Page 13 >>
 position reports .  They could,  however , increase the data -collection rate up to every five 
minutes if required.   
4.3.5.  The position information received from the Jubilee  preceding the sinking sh owed that the 
vessel was drifting.  If the vessel had been  drifting , it would have been  very unlikely to strike 
anything with enough force to pierce the hull.  
4.3.6.  The dive survey carried out by the Commission did not show any significant damage (see 
above) to  the hull other than that which  occurred after the sinking. There was no indication of 
any other vessels nearby  at the time of the foundering.  
Finding  
1. The Jubilee  sinking was very unlikely to have been caused by fishing 
operations, collision with any object or a leaking propeller shaft seal . 
 
Flooding of the engine room  
4.3.7.  Flooding of the engine room was unlikely to have been the cause of the vessel sinking.  
4.3.8.  Calculation s show ed that even if  the engine room had been  totally flooded with water, the 
vessel would not have sunk  and would still have  had positive stability.  However, the free 
surfac e14 effect of a partially filled engine compartment would have reduce d the stability of 
the vessel , possibly  to a point where a large wave might have cause d it to caps ize.  Therefore,  
this scenario is considered further.  
4.3.9.  The Commission  consider ed several possible mechanisms for water entering the engine room:  
 through a leaking propeller shaft seal  (discounted - see the introduction to  the analysis 
above)  
 from a damaged main engine cooling -water system  
 back-flooding through the bilge system  
 flooding from a damaged seawater intake or  associated pipework . 
4.3.10.  It was unlikely that damage to the main engine cooling system caused the engine room to 
flood .  The main engine cooling system was a closed system with keel coolers .  For the engine 
room to flood through this system , the keel coolers would have had to be holed at two points : 
one outside the hull and one within the engine room.   
4.3.11.  The Commission was unable to determine from t he surveys of the sunken vessel whether 
there was damage to the keel coolers or the main sea suction.  However, the pipework in the 
engine room  was in good condition , and if water had entered the engine room bilge it would 
have been automatic ally pumped ou t by the  submersible pump in the engine room .  If water 
had been  entering the engine room from this source and the  rate of ingress had exceeded the 
capacity of the submersible pump , the high-level bilge alarm would  have sounded and alerted 
the crew at an e arly stage.  Therefore,  the Commission consider ed it very unlik ely that the 
sinking was attributable to a damaged cooling -water system . 
4.3.12.  Back flooding into the engine room through the bilge system was unlikely to have caused the 
sinking.  The engine -driven water pump ran continuously when the engine was running and 
                                                        
14 Free surface effect is a change in the stability of a vessel caused by liquids moving about freely in a tank or 
hold. As a vessel rolls, liquids in the tanks or breached compartments accentuate the roll by moving freely 
from side to side of the tank s, accumulating first on one side and then the  other, and may adversely affect 
the stability of the ship. The free service effect can be reduced by having baffles in a tank to reduce the free 
movement or by either emptying the tank or filling it complete ly (USLegal, 2016) .

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 was normally configured to suck from the sea and discharge  through a pipe and hose on the 
main deck  that was led over -side through one of the scuppers .  Divers confirmed that the 
engine -driven pump was set up in this normal configuration .  Therefore,  water could not  have  
back flood ed through this pump because it was n ot connected to the bilge system , nor could 
the water have been discharged into the fish hold (see Figure 5).  
4.3.13.  However, F igure 5 shows a potential path for water  to have  back -flooded  through the bilge 
system and enter ed the engine room  via the electric -driven pump.  
4.3.14.  The electrically driven water pump only ran when manually switched o n.  It discharged through 
piping that ran overhead along the roof of the weatherproof shelter to a valve and hose at the 
aft end.  The dive surveys  confirmed  that: 
 the pump switch was in the on position  
 the inlet valve on the pump system was set to bilge suction  
 the discharge valve on the pump system was set to discharge through the 
deck piping.   
 The valve at the aft end of the weatherproof shelter was set to open  
 the valve on the bilge suction manifold was set to draw (suck) from the engine 
room bilge.   
4.3.15.  If the pump had not been  running and the end of the hose had been  in the water, there was 
potential for water to siphon back into the engine room bilge .  However,  it would have taken a 
very strong siphon suction to draw water high enough and through the pipework , which ran

 return valve15 that was designed to prevent this scenario.  T he engine room bilge non -return 
valve was recovered from the vessel.  When tested it was found to leak back a small amount 
under mains water pressure.  T he amount siphoned back would have been very small due to 
the constriction of the non -return valve ; another non -return  valve was located at the end of the 
bilge suction pipe that would have also sto pped or restricted any siphoning .  Any water 
potentially entering the engine room would automatically have been pumped overboard and a 
bilge alarm sounded in the wheelhouse.  
4.3.16.  The setting of the electric -driven water pump to suck from the engine room bilge w as unusual.  
Interviews with other crew who had worked on the Jubilee  confirmed this.  As already 
mentioned, t he engine room bilge was serviced by a separate automatic submersible bilge 
pump with its own separate discharge pipe.  Any water collecting in th e bilge was 
automatically pumped overboard without any intervention by the crew.  Why the crew set this 
bilge pump to draw from the engine room is unclear . 
4.3.17.  The a ctivation of the engine room high -level bilge alarm would have been  one reason for 
setting the bilge system to pump from the engine room.  In the  following section we describe  
why a flooding of the fish hold was the most likely reason for the sinking .   
4.3.18.  A flooded fish hold  would have result ed in the vessel assuming a large trim16 by the stern.  A 
large stern trim  would  have  cause d any residual water lying in the engine room bilge to run to  
the aft end of the bilge where the high -level bilge alarm was located , which could  have cause d 
the high-level bilge  alarm to sound in the wheelhouse , even if the  quantity of water were  small .  
A crew member would have naturally inves tigate d the cause of such an  alarm  and ma de 
preparations to pump the bilge .   
4.3.19.  A crew member would have been  required  to enter the engine room to set the bilge system to 
draw from the e ngine room bilge .  If there had been  very little water in the engine room, this 
should have been obvious to him at the time.   Nevertheless, there would have been  good  
reason to leave  the configuration of the bilge pumping arrangement  to draw from the engine 
room .  A large trim by the stern is indicative of the vessel taking water in the fish hold.  The 
engine room bilge system could not have been used to pump out the fish hold, so it would 
have made good sense to leave the bilge syste m set to draw from the engine room in case it 
too started flooding.  
4.3.20.  Notwithstanding that the bilge arrangement was found set to draw from the engine room bilge, 
the main reason s for discounting engine room flooding as the cause of the sinking were : 
 even with the engine room fully flooded, the vessel would not have sunk and would still 
have had positive stability  
 the early warning that the bilge alarm w ould have given the crew would have given  them 
ample time to raise the alarm and take corrective action . 
Finding  
2. The Jubilee  sinking was unlikely to have been caused by flooding of the engine 
room, although it could not be ruled out as a contributing factor . 
 
                                                        
15 A non -return valve is a valve that will only let a fluid pass in one direction . 
16 Trim is the difference between the dra ught  forward and the dra ught  aft. Dra ught is the depth of a hull 
below the water.   If the aft draught  is greater, the vessel is descr ibed as being trimmed by the stern ; if the 
forward dra ught  is greater, the vessel  is trimmed by the bow .  A large or excessive trim, caused by excess 
weight forward or aft, will reduce the freeboard forward or aft, will change the vessel 's condition from the 
designed seagoing trim and may affect the seakeeping characteristics of the vessel .

 4.3.21.  It was likely that the Jubilee  sank due to t he fish hold being flooded.  T his was the only space 
that could,  alone , have cause d the Jubilee  to sink, even  before the hold was completely full of 
water.   
4.3.22.  If the fish hold had filled with water , the stability of the vessel would have been  reduced due to 
the effect of free surface and the raising of the virtual centre of gravity.  As the stability 
reduced the vessel would  have  become more susceptible to rolling and potentially capsizing 
by a large wave.  
4.3.23.  A naval architect calculated the stability of the vessel for several operating condition s as 
required under Maritime Rules Part 40D.  After the accident this naval architect produced a 
report showing possible gradual flooding scenarios for the two major spaces, the fish hold and 
the engine room, and the effect s of the aft space being flooded with water (see Appendix 2).  
These flooding calculations have been verified by the Commission.   
4.3.24.  The calculations carried out by the naval architect showed that the fish hold only needed to be 
between 60% and 7 0% full before down -flooding17 occurred  into o ther compartments .  Down -
flooding would occur through unsecured openings in the deck or the superstructure  and would 
cause the vessel to sink by the stern . 
During the post -accident dive surveys it could not be determined whether the watertight hatch 
into the aft compartment  (see Figure 2) was secured.  If it were  not secure , water would have 
entered this space as the vessel trimmed  by the stern.  In that scenario the Jubilee  would have 
lost positive  stability when the fish hold was only about 40% flooded (see Appendix 2).  
How could water have entered the fish hold?  
4.3.25.  It was unlikely that seawater from wave action on deck was the main contributor  to the 
sinking.  When the Jubilee  first entered service it was known to be 'wet on deck '.  However, t he 
freeing ports18 had been successfully modified to reduce the amount of seawater washing 
onto the deck.  Despite these modifications the sea conditions during the night would normally 
have resulted in some water on deck.   
4.3.26.  There were two hatches leading t o the fish hold.   The main and larger of the two  hatches 
opened upwards  from  a raised coaming19 that extended 300 millimetre s (mm)  above deck  
level.  It  was positioned further forward under the weatherproof cover .  The  RNZN dive team 
found that the main hatch (see Figure 2) was closed but not secured.  As it could not  be 
established what actions the crew took after discovering their plight, it is not possible to say 
whether this hatch was open during the night.  Neverthe less, given its position and the height 
of the coaming it would have been  unlikely to flood in anything but exceptional seas . 
4.3.27.  The smaller fish hatch was located further aft and in a position more exposed to the weather.  
It was not fitted with a coaming, b ut instead it was flush with the deck  and opened downwards 
into the fish hold .  It had a protective coaming constructed around it, but this had drain ports 
that allowed water to drain from or enter the coa ming.  When the RNZN dive team carried out 
the init ial dives to recover the crew they found that the fish hatch (see Figure s 2 and 10 ) 
appeared to be closed flush with the deck.  Again, because  it could not  be established what 
actions the crew took after discovering their plight, it is not possible to say whether this hatch 
was open during the night.  
4.3.28.  The fish hatch was not fitted with a latching mechanism.  It relied on hydraulic pressure in the 
closing ram to keep it closed and sealed.  If the hydraulic pump had not been operating and 
the pressure in the h ydraulic cylinder had reduced for whatever reason (such as a minor

heel, trim, or submergence of the vessel  
18 A freeing port is an opening in the bottom of a bulwark for rapid drainage of a weather deck in heavy seas . 
19 A coaming is any vertical surface on a vessel that is designed to deflect or prevent the entry of water. 
Usually it refers to a raised section of deck plating around an opening, such as a hatch. Coamings also 
provide a frame onto which a hatch cover can be fitted . 

<< Page 18 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -203 hydraulic leak) , the hatch may have  open ed slightly , allowing ingress of water .  This is a safety 
issue that the owner has addressed on vessels constructed after the Jubilee . 
4.3.29.  The fish hatch could be opened and closed simply by operating buttons in  the wheelhouse, but 
it was not easily observable from the wheelhouse.  In the past it had been inadvertently left 
open on completion of fishing.   However, even if the hatch had been i nadvertently left open 
during the night, it is unlikely that seawater from wave action on  the deck alone could  have  
enter ed the fish hold in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the capacity of the automatic bilge 
pump located in the fish hold  unless it was bl ocked .   
4.3.30.  The fish hold bilge was fitted with a submersible electric pump that was controlled by a float 
switch.  The pump discharged directly overboard through its own dedicated pipework.  It is 
possible that water from a hose supplied by one of the vessel 's fire and bilge pumps in the 
engine room exceed ed the capacity of this pump .  This had happened on the previous voyage  
with a different crew .  The crew had been using the deck wash hose to help wash the fish into 
the fish hold from the chute between the fish table and the fish hatch.  The deck wash hose 
had been left running and the fish hatch left open .  The fish hold had begun  to fill with water 
because the capacity of the deck wash pump was greater than the capacity of the bilge pump  
in the fish hold .  The crew had identified the problem and stopped the electrically driven deck 
wash pump , after which  the fish hold bilge pump  had cleared the water.  
4.3.31.  The Commission received anecdotal evidence that the fish hold had flooded on another 
occasion for similar reasons.  However, the owner and operators were unaware of this as it 
had not been reported to them or to the relevant authorities.  
4.3.32.  The electric deck wash pump was located in the engine room, close to the wheelhouse and 
crew sleeping quarters.  It  is difficult to know whether the noise it made  when running would 
have been noticeable  to the crew , or distinguishable above all the other noise s associated 
with a fishing vessel drifting in a moderate sea with its engine running.  
4.3.33.  Table 1 demonstrates how the capa city of the fish hold bilge pump could have been  exceeded 
by the capacity of the electric ally driven deck wash pump.   The electric deck wash pump and 
the submersible electric bilge pump were likely to  have had a reduced capacity through  age; 
however , as th e Commission was unable to clarify the amount of loss or the actual capacity of 
the pumps at the time of the accident , the owner -supplied data has been used.  
  
Capacity of submersible electric bilge pump 
(owner -supplied data)  16.8 tonnes per hour - output20 
Capacity of electric deck wash pump  
(owner -supplied data)  27.6 tonnes per hour - input  
Difference (input versus output)  10.8 tonnes per hour - input  
Time between telephone call between 
vessels and mayday call (0030 -0420)  Approximately 3.8 hours  
Capacity of fish hold 77 tonnes 
approximately  10.8 tonnes for 3.8 hours =  40.28 tonnes

4.3.34.  During the dive survey the fish hold bilge pump was retrieved from the vessel for further 
testing.  The testing ( Figure 11 showed that the pump was not blocked and appeared to be in 
good working order.  The impeller could be rotated by hand.  However, it was not possible to 
test the fish hold bilge pipe to check if it was blocked.   
4.3.35.  Divers found t he electrically driven deck w ash pump hose end over the side of the vessel.   If 
the hose from the electric driven pump had been  left running into the fish hold, and assuming 
that the fish hold automatic bilge pump had been  working and not blocked, the time it would 
have taken to fill the fish hold enough to sink the vessel correspond ed closely with the time 
between the crew "parking up for the night" and the distress radio call being made.    
4.3.36.  It was about as likely as not tha t this was the main source of water accumulating in the fish 
hold.  However, t here are two variables or caveats to this hypothesis . 
4.3.37.  First, as mentioned above, the electric -driven pump in the engine room was found configured  
to draw from the engine room bil ge - not from the main seawater suction, as it would have to 
have been for it to pump water into the fish hold.  The crew would have to have reconfigured 
the pump from supplying water to the fish hold to drawing from the engine room bilge once 
the problem was discovered.  
4.3.38.  Secondly, the fish hatch was found by divers to be closed flush with the deck.  Either the hatch 
had been open and then closed by the crew when the problem was discovered, or the hose 
had been  left through the main fish hold hatch, which th e divers found closed but not secured.  
4.3.39.  The fish hold bilge was not fitted with a bilge alarm and there was no visual alarm at the 
steering position in the wheelhouse to indicate when the pump was operating.  The absence of 
a visual alarm  was a serious safe ty issue and was contrary to Maritime Rules Part 40(D).28 
(6)(d) (see Appendix 3).  
4.3.40.  Bilge alarms in spaces that frequently have water in them due to normal operations are 
problematic.  Repetitive or 'nuisance' alarms are distracting for crew , and crew have been 
known to silence or bypass them.  In such spaces, the installation of a second bilge alarm 
mounted higher in the compartment is a good defence against abnormal quantities of wat er 
accumulating in the space.  Since the accident t he Jubilee 's owner has installed such alarms 
in the fish holds of its other fishing vessels.

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 Figure 11 
Shore -based examination of the recovered electric bilge pump from the fish hold  
Finding s 
3. It was likely that flooding of the Jubilee 's fish hold was the main factor 
contributing to it s sinking , or capsizing and sinking . 
4. It was about as likely as not that the cause of the fish hold flooding was water 
from a deck wash hose that had been left running through an open hatch .  
5. The rate of water from the deck  wash hose exceeded the pumping rate of the 
automatic submersible bilge pump in the fish hold.  
6. The fish hatch was susceptible to being left fully or partially open because it 
was hydraulically closed from the wheelhouse and could not be latched closed.  
7. The bilge pumping system on the Jubilee  was not fitted with any means of 
automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an 
abnormal level.  If the crew had been alerted to the level of water in the fish 
hold, it is as likely as not  that the sinking would have been prevented.   
8. The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alerted  
the crew  when the bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping 
system was non-complian t with Maritime Rules.  There was no other means 
fitted to the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew to excess water in the fish 
hold.   
4.4. Why were the crew unable to escape from the wheelhouse?  
4.4.1.  The skipper and crew of the Jubilee  were aware that they were in trouble .  They tri ed to 
telephone the Legacy  but the call was n ot answered.  The Commission was unable to 
establish why the call was made.  Almost immediately after this the skipper issued a distress 
call saying they were taking on water and then said they were "getting off  and getting in the 
liferaft now" .  This was the last transmission received.  

 
Final Report MO -2015 -203 
<< Page 23 >>
 4.4.2.  It could not be established when and for how long the crew were aware of their predicament.   
As discussed above , one of the crew was fully clothed and the other two were dressed i n what 
was probably sleeping attire .   
Means of escape  
4.4.3.  The majority of small New Zealand fishing vessels, especially those of older design, usually 
have  easy exits from the wheelhouse, either through a door to the starboard21 or port side or 
through an open ing window.   
4.4.4.  On the Jubilee  the only direct exit from the wheelhouse was aft through the sl iding wheelhouse 
door onto the m ain deck .  The main deck  was covered for the majority of its length by a 
weatherproof shelter.  To reach the liferaft the crew would  have had to either turn hard right 
and go through the door on the port side leading out to the foredeck, or move aft and climb 
the ladder to the top of the shelter deck22 roof.  
4.4.5.  It could not be established whether the Jubilee  simply sank by the stern or cap sized first and 
then sank.  The behaviour of a sinking vessel is difficult to predict, as there are so many 
variables in buoyancy and stability, depending on which compartments are flooded and in 
what order.  
4.4.6.  Whatever happened  occurred  quickly , because all three crew members were trapped inside 
the wheelhouse with the sliding door leading on  to the main deck shut.  One panel that closed 
off the compartment where the lifejackets were stowed was dislodged, possibly indicative of 
the crew attempting to don lifejackets before abandoning the vessel.  When the crew were 
recovered, none of them was wearing  a lifejacket.   
4.4.7.  The design of the wheelhouse did not afford ample opportunity for escape.  With t he vessel 
sinking by the stern, the option of escape onto the roof of the shelter deck would not have 
been  possible  (see Figure 6).  Even crossing to the port side to access the foredeck would 
have been difficult.  If the vessel capsized, opening the heavy  sliding door would have been  
difficult, if not almost impossible.  
4.4.8.  The other means of escape from the wheelhouse was via the emergency escape through the 
forecastle accommodation.  Once in the forecastle accommodation the crew would have had 
to remove a wo oden 'plug' in the forward bulkhead , which concealed a watertight hatch into 
the chain locker space.  Once access had been gained to the chain locker space the crew 
would have had to open another  watertight hatch to access the vessel's foredeck.  
4.4.9.  It was very unlikely that the crew would have succeeded in escaping a sinking vessel by this 
route, which was designed for escape in the event of fire.  
4.4.10.  Ensuring adequate m eans of escape in any emergency on board a small vessel is a serious 
safety issue.  Designers need to consider as many scenarios as practicable and provide 
sufficient alternatives for the crew to escape in any event.  The Jubilee 's owner , which  also 
built the vessel , has addressed this by providing better means of escape in vessels built after 
the Jubilee . 
Did the means of escape comply with  the Maritime Rules?  
4.4.11.  As part of the inquiry  the Commission considered whether the alternative means of escape 
through the forecastle and chain locker met the intent of the Maritime Rules.  
4.4.12.  The watertight hatches fitted between the forecastle accommodation and the chain locker, 
and the chain locker and the open deck , were of identical construction.  They were of a 
proprietary brand and gave a clear space opening of 18 inches by 24 inches (457  mm by 610  
                                                        
21 Starboard is the right -hand si de of a vessel when looking forward . 
22 A shelter deck is a continuous deck of light construction above the principal deck of a vessel , usually 
covering a full -length superstructure or space not permanently closed against the weather . 

<< Page 24 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -203 mm) (see Appendix 4) , which was 23% less than the standard clear opening area of 600  mm 
by 600  mm23.   
4.4.13.  The discrepancy in clear opening size was noted by a naval architect of the company surveying 
the construction of the vessel, who in a letter to the company building the vessel said that:  
The clear opening of the door does not meet the normal standard mi nimum 
opening of at least 600 mm.  The attending surveyor is to satisfy himself that the 
proposed opening of the hatch does not compromise the efficacy and safety of 
the crew in any event  
The attending surveyor considered that this was satisfactory and the hatches were approved 
in accordance with Maritime Rule s Part 40(D).14 - Hatchway openings and covers and other 
deck openings , section (10)  (d) (see Appendix 4).   
 
Figure 12  
Watertight hatch to the chain locker as fitted to a sister vessel of the Jubilee . This is the same design 
and size as the hatches fitted to the Jubilee  between the forecastle space and the chain locker and the 
chain locker and  the deck.   
4.4.14.  Maritime Rule s Part 40(D)  Fire protection , paragraph 62 - Means of es cape (see Appendix 3) 
states that:  
(1) Where reasonable and practicable, and having regard to the number of 
crew utilising the space and size of space, at least two means of escape, one of 
which may be the normal means of access, as widely separated as pos sible, 
must be provided from each section of accommodation and service spaces…  
                                                        
23 The vessel was const ructed under the original Maritime Rule, which came into force on 1 February 2001.  
Maritime Rule 40D.66 Deck openings:  
(2) Dimensions of access hatches must not be less than 600mm by 600mm or 600mm diameter  
 

 
Final Report MO -2015 -203 
<< Page 25 >>
 (2) Normal means of access to accommodation and service spaces below the 
open deck must be arranged so that it is possible to reach the open deck without 
passing through interv ening spaces containing a potential source of fire.  
(3)  The second means of escape may be through portholes, windows or 
hatches of adequate size and preferably leading to the open deck.  
4.4.15.  Although not defined in the Maritime Rules, Maritime New Zealand  stated:  
that the generally understood meaning of 'open deck ' is anywhere on a vessel 
that is exposed and not within a weathertight or watertight area or within the 
shelter deck area of a vessel .   
4.4.16.  The means of escape from the forecastle accommodation may not have met the intent of 
paragraph s 62(2) and (3) .  The normal means of access to the accommodation space passed 
through the wheelhouse and living quarters where a risk of fire existed.  The secondary means 
of escape passed through the intervening chain locker space, rather than the 'preference' of  
leading directly to the open deck.   
4.4.17.  The means of escape from the wheelhouse may not have met  the intent of Maritime Rule s 
40(D).62 , paragraphs 2 and 3.  The normal means of access to  the wheelhouse , through th e 
aft sliding door,  then passed through the "shelter " that covered the main deck before it was 
possible to gain access to the open deck, and the secondary means of escape passed through 
two intervening compartments before reaching the open deck.   
4.4.18.  Whether these means of access or escape met the intent of the Maritime Rules would depend 
on what was "reasonable and practicable, and having regard to the number of crew utilizing 
the space and the sizes of the space " as specified in paragraph (1)  
4.4.19.  Notwithstanding the Maritime Rules, w hen designing or fitting a shelter -type structure that 
covers an open deck , the owner should use a risk -based approach to identify suitable means 
of escape for the crew in an emergency.   
4.4.20.  It is concerning  that the wheelhouse , where the crew were found, where the y were  most likely 
to gather in an emergency , and where the lifejackets were  stowed , had no escape  route  
direct ly to the open deck.  
4.4.21.  Certificates of compliance issued by safe ship management companies show tha t the vessel s 
have been assessed as complying with, at least, the minimum standards required under the 
rules and regulations.  H owever, the concept of safety management systems is that owners 
and operators should take a risk -based approach to their operati ons.  Hazards must be 
identified  and risks must be assessed and reduced to as low as reasonably practicable to 
prevent damage to property and harm to people.   This means that owners and operators 
cannot rely solely on compliance with the minimum technical standards laid out in maritime 
rules for meeting their obligations  under safety management systems .   
4.4.22.  The Maritime Rules do not give any guidance on what is , and what is not,  an acceptable 
standard , but leave the decision of acceptability to surveyors ' discretion.  This creates 
inconsistency in application between surveyors and also between surveyors and Maritime New 
Zealand .  What may be acceptable to one surveyor may not be acceptable to another or for 
that matter to Maritime New Zealand.   
4.4.23.  Since the construction and certification of the vessel, Maritime New Zealand has changed the 
safety management system from the 'old' safe ship management system to the 'new' 
Maritime Operators Safety System (MOSS).  This has allowed Maritime New Zealand to have 
oversight of survey, audit and construction requirements.  In the absence of guidelines, the 
Director of Maritime New Zealand can now give advice to ensure more consistency in 
acceptable standards.  
4.4.24.  Maritime New Zealand has also formed a surveyors advisory grou p to give advice to surveyors 
and monitor standards to achieve consistency in the application of the Maritime Rules.

 5. Findings  
5.1. The Jubilee  sinking was very unlikely to have been caused by fishing operations, collision with 
any object or a leaking propeller shaft seal . 
5.2. The Jubilee  sinking was unlikely to have been caused by flooding of the engine room, although 
it could not be ruled out as a contributing factor . 
5.3. It was likely that flooding of the Jubilee 's fish hold was the main factor contributing to it s 
sinking, or capsizing and sinking . 
5.4. It was about as likely as not that the cause of the fish hold flooding was water from a deck 
wash hose that had been lef t running through an open hatch.  
5.5. The rate  of water from the deck wash hose exceeded the pumping rate of the automatic 
submersible bilge pump in the fish hold.  
5.6. The fish hatch was susceptible to being left fully or partially open because it was hydraulically 
closed from the wheelhouse and could not  be latched closed.  
5.7. The bilge pumping system on the Jubilee  was not fitted with any means of automatically 
alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level.  If the crew had 
been alerted to the level of water in the fish hold , it is as likely as not that the sinking would 
have been prevented.   
5.8. The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alert ed the crew when the 
bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping system was non -compliant with 
Maritime Rules.  There was no other means fitted to the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew 
to excess water in the fish hold.  
5.9. The means of escape from the Jubilee 's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency afforded the 
crew too few options for escaping in the event of capsize or sinking.  
5.10.  The means of escape from the Jubilee 's wheelhouse and accommoda tion space may not have 
met the intent of the Maritime Rules for providing escape for crew in the ev ent of fire.   
5.11.  There is a lack of advice and guidance in the Maritime Rules on what is an acceptable 
standard for surveyors to approve when the Maritime Rules defer to the surveyors ' discretion.

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 6. Safety a ctions  
General  
6.1. The Commission classifies  safety a ctions  by two types : 
(a) safety actions  taken by the regulator or an operator to address safety issues identified 
by the Commission during an inquiry that would otherwise result in the Commission 
issuing a recommendation  
(b) safety  actions taken by the regulator  or an operator  to address other safety issues that 
would not normally result in the Commission issuing a recommendation.  
Safety a ctions  addressing safety issues identified during an inquiry  
6.2. Since the accident the vessel's owner has made changes to the Jubilee 's sister vessels:  
 fitted a proximity switch to the fish hatch so that there is now an open light (red) and a 
green light (closed) on the control station in the wheelhouse to indicate to skipper and 
crew if the hatch is not closed   
 welded up the drain holes in the coaming around the fish hatch and fitted a lay -flat 
hose to the coaming to allow any water entrapped inside the coaming to drain out but 
reduce the risk of back flooding  
 fitted  two 2 -inch [50 mm] drain pipes with non -return valves in the aft step of the fish 
hold to the shaft tunnel.  So that if water builds up in fish hold it would drain into the 
shaft tunnel where there is a bilge alarm and an automatic pump   
 fitted another b ilge sump with pump and discharge pipework, including suction loop 
onto deck in the fish hold   
 fitted bilge alarms (one each side) in the fish hold along with lights and buzzers on 
deck for bilge alarms   
 installed wheelhouse glass breaking hammers and si gnage on both sides of the 
wheelhouse interior in addition to the r egulation  escape hatches    
 fitted an access hatch in the shelter deck window screen, with a ladder from the main 
deck below to provide an alternative escape route   
 moved the liferaft and man -overboard ladder from starboard to port on the 
wheelhouse top to provide better access.  A 24v [24-volt] locally switched light was 
also fitted   
 fitted an additional ladder from the foredeck to wheelhouse top on the portside.   
Safety a ctions  addressing other safety issues  
6.3. Since the accident the vessel's owner has made changes to a similar vessel in its fleet:  
 fitted a proximity switch to the fish hatch so that there is now an open light (red) and a 
green light (closed) on the co ntrol station in the wheelhouse to indicate to skipper and 
crew if the hatch is not closed   
 raised the coaming height around the fish hatch to 600  mm from the regulation 300  
mm 
 installed wheelhouse glass breaking hammers and signage on both sides of the 
wheelhouse interior in addition to the regulation escape hatches .

 7. Recommendations  
General  
7.1. The Commissi on may issue, or give notice of , recommendations to any person or organisation 
that it considers the most appropriate to address the identified safety issues, depending on 
whether these safety issues are applicable to a single operator only or to the wider transport 
sector.   In this case , recommendations have been issued to Maritime New Zealand  
7.2. In the interests of transport safety it is important that these recommendations are 
implemented without delay  to help prevent  similar accidents or incidents occurring in the 
future.  
Recommendations  
7.3. The largest -volume compartment on the vessel, the fish hold, did not have any automatic 
means of alerting the crew to excess water in the space, but relied on manual sighting through 
the main hatch to determine the amount of water in the hold.   
7.4. This situ ation had gone undetected during the construction of the vessel, the issuance of a fit -
for-purpose certificate, entry into the safe ship management system and subsequent internal 
and external audits , and approximately seven years of commercial use.   
7.5. On 27  April 2017  the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand 
draw surveyors ' and vessel owners ' attention to  the benefits of installing safety mechanisms 
designed to alert crew to any abnormal rises in water levels in compartments, part icularly 
those compartments that compromise the reserve buoyancy or stability of fishing vessels. 
[016/17]   
On 11 May 2017, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
A safety bulletin will be prepared to draw attention to surveyors, vessel owners and 
operators of the benefits of installing safety mechanisms designed to alert crew of 
any abnormal rises in water levels in compartments, particularly those 
compartments that compromise the reserve buoyancy of stability of fishing vessels.  
The safety bulleting will be publis hed on the MNZ website by the end of May 2017.  
All surveyors will be notified when it is available.  Vessel owners and operators will be 
advised through our normal communications process.  
7.6. On the Jubilee , the only exits from accommodation spaces were eithe r aft through the 
wheelhouse door to the enclosed shelter  deck , or forward through the forecastle space then 
through a hatch to the chain locker space, then through another sealed hatch to the vessel's 
forecastle deck.   
7.7. On 27 April 2017  the Commission rec ommended that the Director  of Maritime New Zealand 
work with surveyors and designers of fishing vessels to ensure that fishing vessels have 
effective means of escape from all compartments for all reasonably foreseeable emergency 
situations.  [014/17] 
On 11 May 2017, Maritime New Zealand replied:  
Maritime New Zealand will work with surveyors and designers of fishing vessels to 
ensure that fishing vessels have effective means of escape from all compartments 
for all reasonably foreseeable emergency situations.  
Maritime NZ holds regular seminars with surveyors where safety matters are raised 
and discussed.  Guidance for surveyors and designers of fishing vessels will be 
developed in consultation with surveyors.  The guidance will be available on the MNZ 
website a nd surveyors will be notified when it is available.  We anticipate this will be 
completed by June 2018.  This matter will also be raised at the next surveyor 
seminar.  We will also ensure owners and operators are made aware of the issue.  
I will send copies  of the safety bulletin and guidance for surveyors to you when the 
documents have been completed.

 Final Report MO -2015 -203 8. Key l essons  
8.1. Good watchkeeping includes not only looking after the safe navigation of the vessel,  but also 
being vigilant to the state of trim and stability of  the vessel and any factors that could affect 
either . 
8.2. Notwithstanding the minimum requirements set out in Maritime Rules, o wners and designers 
of vessels should take a risk -based approach to designing and providing escape routes from 
all compa rtments for a ll foreseeable emergencies.  
8.3. Crews need to assess and pre-plan escape routes from any part of their vessel s for all 
foreseeable emergency situations .

 Appendix 3:   Extracts from Maritime Rules Part 40(D)  
Maritime Rule Part 40(D).14 - Hatchway openings and covers and other deck openings  
(1)  All hatchway openings — 
 (a)  must be provided with covers; and  
(b)  if intended to be open during fishing operations, must be arranged near to the ship's 
centreline, except where other hatch positions are approved by the surveyor.  
(10)  The owner of a fishing ship must ensure that —  
(a)  every escape hatch must be capable of being opened from each side of its cover; and  
(b)  every hinged escape hatch cover must be protected against accidental closing; and  
(c)  every heavy cover on an escape hatch must be fitted with appropriate coun terweights; and  
(d)  the dimensions and location of escape hatches must be to the satisfaction of the surveyor; 
and  
(e)  if deemed necessary by a surveyor, hand holds or other aids must be fitted to enable 
effective use of the escape hatch.  
Maritime Rule Part 40(D).28  - Bilge pumping arrangements  
(1) Except as provided in 40D.28(2), an efficient bilge pumping system must be provided that under 
all practicable conditions must be capable of pumping from and draining any watertight 
compartment that is not a p ermanent oil or water tank whether the ship is upright or listed.  
(2) With the approval of the surveyor watertight compartments of less than 7 percent of the total 
under deck volume may be drained into an adjacent compartment by means of self -closing valve  
or cock.  The valve or cock must be fitted outside the compartment being drained and be 
operable  from a readily accessible position.  Ships of less than 12 metres in length having 
watertight compartments filled with a buoyancy material approved by a surve yor are not required 
to have bilge pumping arrangements from those compartments.   
(6) In ships of less than 24 metres in length. the surveyor may permit at least one fixed heavy duty 
electrically driven submersible pump to be fitted in an individual water tight compartment in lieu 
of a piped suction. Where such submersible bilge pumps are ﬁtted - 
(a) in no case is the capacity of die fitted submersible bilge pumps in any one compartment to 
be less than 8 metres3/hour; and  
(b) in the main machinery space the re must be at least two means of bilge suction one of 
which may be a submersible bilge pump; and  
(c) each submersible bilge pump is to be fitted with a float switch which automatically 
operates that pump or an audible alarm at the steering position. Any su ch ﬂoat switch is to 
be protected from jamming by bilge debris; and  
(d) each submersible bilge pump is to have at visual alarm at the steering position to indicate 
when it is running; and  
(e) each submersible bilge pump must be accessible for inspection, r emoval or maintenance 
without removal of permanent ship structure; and  

<< Page 42 >>
 Final Report MO -2015 -203 (f) electrically driven submersible bilge pumps rated for 12V. 24V or 32V 'DC are to comply 
with the International Standard ISO 8849:1990 Small! Craft — Electrically operated bilge 
pump s or an equivalent standard7: and  
(g) there must be two sources of electrical supply on the ship which are capable of running the 
pumps in any one compartment for 12 hours; and  
(h) on ships of 12 metres or more in length emergency bilge pumping arrangement s must be 
provided for compartments outside the main machinery space which are ﬁtted with only 
one submersible bilge pump. This may be a portable submersible self -priming pump of 8 
metres3/hour capacity which is stowed with its hoses in a readily accessibl e location; and  
(i) discharge piping arrangements are to be such that at least two automatic non - return 
devices are ﬁtted between the overboard discharge and compartment being served by the 
submersible bilge pump. One of these devices is to be an automati c non -return valve 
situated at or near the shell and the other may be a pipework loop taken up to the highest 
practicable point below the weathertight deck.  
(7) In any ship, where fish handling or processing may cause quantities of water to accumulate in 
enclosed spaces, adequate drainage must be provided.  
Maritime Rule Part 40(D).62  - Means of escape  
 (1) Where reasonable and practicable, and having regard to the number of crew utilising the space 
and size of space, at least two means of escape, one of which may be the normal means of 
access, as widely separated as possible, must be provided from each secti on of accommodation 
and service spaces.  
(2)  Normal means of access to accommodation and service spaces below the open deck must be 
arranged so that it is possible to reach the open deck without passing through intervening spaces 
containing a potential so urce of fire.  
(3)  The second means of escape may be through portholes, windows or hatches of adequate size 
and preferably leading to the open deck.  
(4)  Where the means of escape from a machinery space is by ladder, a steel ladder must be fitted.  
(5)  Where the surveyor considers a machinery space to be sufficiently large, the space must have 
two means of escape as widely spaced as possible.  
Maritime Rule Part 22 - Collision Regulations  
Section 1  - Steering and Sailing  
SUBSECTION 1  - CONDUCT OF VESSELS IN ANY CONDITION OF  VISIBILITY  
22.4 Application of Subsection 1  
Rules in this subsection apply in any condition of visibility.  
22.5 Look -out 
Every vessel must at all times maintain a proper look -out by sight and hearing as well as by all available 
means ap propriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions, so as to make a full appraisal of the 
situation and the risk of collision.
