- name: Bilge Pumping System Monitoring
  explanation: The bilge pumping system's lack of an automatic alert for abnormal water levels in the fish hold was a significant safety issue. The crew was not alerted when the water in the fish hold reached a critical level, which likely contributed to the sinking. "the bilge pumping system on the jubilee was not fitted with any means of automatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an abnormal level" (4.3.40). Additionally, the absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse to alert the crew when the bilge pump was running meant that the system was non-compliant with Maritime Rules, leaving the crew unaware of the accumulating water. "There was no other means fitted to the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew to excess water in the fish hold" (4.3.40).
- name: Vessel Stability and Buoyancy
  explanation: The vessel's stability and buoyancy were compromised due to water ingress, which is a fundamental aspect of maritime safety. The analysis showed that the fish hold only needed to be between 60% and 70% full before down-flooding occurred into other compartments, leading to the vessel sinking by the stern. "the calculations carried out by the naval architect showed that the fish hold only needed to be between 60% and 70% full before down-flooding occurred into other compartments" (4.3.24 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant as it highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity of watertight compartments and the critical nature of managing free surface effects on stability.
- name: Emergency Preparedness and Response
  explanation: The crew's inability to effectively respond to the emergency situation suggests a lack of preparedness. The crew tried to make a phone call and issued a distress call but were unable to escape the wheelhouse. "The skipper and crew of the Jubilee were aware that they were in trouble. They tried to telephone the Legacy but the call was not answered" (4.4.1). The fact that all three crew members were trapped inside the wheelhouse with the sliding door shut indicates that emergency response measures were insufficient. "Whatever happened occurred quickly, because all three crew members were trapped inside the wheelhouse with the sliding door leading onto the main deck shut" (4.4.6).
- name: Means of Escape and Evacuation
  explanation: The design of the vessel did not provide adequate means of escape in an emergency, which is a critical safety theme. The wheelhouse had limited escape options, and the secondary means of escape through the forecastle and chain locker did not lead directly to the open deck, potentially not meeting the intent of the Maritime Rules. "the means of escape from the jubilee's wheelhouse in the event of an emergency afforded the crew too few options for escaping in the event of capsize or sinking" (4.4.20 (unvalidated and unrepairable quote)). This theme is relevant as it underscores the importance of having multiple and accessible escape routes for crew safety during emergencies.
- name: Watchkeeping and Crew Alertness
  explanation: The designated watchkeeper's role is crucial for monitoring the vessel's condition and responding to alarms or unusual movements. In this case, the crew's alertness was compromised, possibly due to sleep or distraction. "Someone who was asleep or distracted by using a mobile phone would have been less likely to notice any unusual attitude or movement of the vessel as it was taking on water" (4.2.5). This theme is relevant because it highlights the importance of maintaining a proper lookout and the potential consequences of inattention or fatigue on crew performance and safety.
- name: Compliance with Maritime Rules
  explanation: Compliance with Maritime Rules is a fundamental safety theme, as these rules are designed to ensure the safety of maritime operations. In this incident, the vessel's bilge pumping system was found to be non-compliant with the rules, lacking a visual indicator to alert the crew when the bilge pump was running. "The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alerted the crew when the bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping system was non-compliant with Maritime Rules" (4.3.40). This theme is relevant as it demonstrates the potential safety implications of non-compliance and the need for vessels to adhere to established safety standards.
