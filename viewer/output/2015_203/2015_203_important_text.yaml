  \  \n4.1.1.  The loss of a relatively new fishing vessel and all of its crew in\
  \ moderate weather conditions is \nunusual and unexpected, more so considering that\
  \ the crew were all experienced fishermen.  \n4.1.2.  For a vessel to sink, or capsize\
  \ and sink, water must enter the vessel in sufficient quantity that \nit either\
  \ overcomes the natu ral buoyancy of the vesse l or erodes the vessel's stability\
  \ to a \npoint where it capsizes.  \n4.1.3.  The Commission considered several scenarios\
  \ that could, or had been  known to , cause  the \nloss of a fishing vessel:  \n\
  \uF0B7 the trawl net catching on an obstruction while the vessel was fishing  \n\
  \uF0B7 the lo ss of the tail -shaft or a leaking stern gland (seal) on the tail\
  \ -shaft  \n\uF0B7 piercing of the vessel's hull due to a collision  with a sub\
  \ merged or semi -submerged \nobject  \n\uF0B7 flooding of the engine room  \n\uF0B7\
  \ flooding of the fish hold . \n4.1.4.  The trawl net could not have been a fa ctor\
  \ because the vessel was not fishing at the time of \nthe a ccident.  D ivers found\
  \ all of the fishing equipment in a stowed condition.  \n4.1.5.  The condition of\
  \ the propeller shaft seal was also unlikely to have been a factor.  Divers later\
  \ \nfound the propeller and the propeller shaft seal in place  and apparently in\
  \ normal condition.  It \nis possible for propeller shafts to develop slow leaks.\
  \  However, it would have taken a \nsubstantial leak to cau se the vessel to founder.\
  \  A ny water entering the propeller shaft space  \nwould have activated  a high\
  \ -level alarm in the wheelhouse and would have been automatically \npumped overboard\
  \ via the stand -alone bilge pump located in the shaft tunnel.  \n4.1.6.  The remaining\
  \ three possible scenarios are discussed in the following sections . \n4.1.7.  Also\
  \ d iscussed are the survivability of the accident and whether the design of the\
  \ vessel \ncontributed to the crew being unable to escape from the sinking vessel.\
  \  \n4.1.8.  The Commission also identified a non -contributing safety issue with\
  \ the Jubilee 's compliance \nwith the Maritime Rules covering means of escape from\
  \ compartments in the event of a fire.  \n4.2. Circumstances  \n4.2.1.  The skipper\
  \ of the Jubilee  had informed the skipper of the Legacy  by telephone that they\
  \  \n\"were going to park up for the night\"8.  Under Maritime Rules Part 22 there\
  \ is a requirement \nfor all vessels when underway9 to maintain a proper l ookout\
  \ and a safe navigational  watch \n(see Appendix 2).   \n4.2.2.  The bodies of all\
  \ three crew members were found in the wheelhouse.  The skipper and one \ncrew member\
  \ were scant ily clothe d, as though they had been asleep .  Neither was wearing\
  \ \nfootwear.  T he third crew member was fully clothed, including wearing laced\
  \ footwear.  It is \nabout as likely as not that he had been the designated watchkeeper,\
  \ assuming one had been \nappointed.  It is  likely that the skipper and the other\
  \ crew member were sleeping as the \naccident sequence unfolded.  \n           \
  \                                             \n8 From interv iews this was considered\
  \ to mean heave the vessel to or drift, as opposed to anchoring, so that \nsome\
  \ or all the crew could rest.   \n9 A vessel that is not made fast to the shore\
  \ or aground.  \n \nFinal Report MO -2015 -203 \n<< Page 11 >>\n 4.2.3.  The designated\
  \ watchkeeper is tasked with keeping a navigational watch and periodically \nchecking\
  \ on  the general cond ition of the vessel .  This include s moni toring any alarms\
  \ and \nbeing alert to any unusual movement of the vessel as it rides  the seas.\
  \  \n4.2.4.  It was not possible to establish who, if anyone, was awake as the events\
  \ unfolded.  M obile \nphone records showed that  the phone be longing to the crew\
  \ member who wa s found fully \nclothed  was connected to  the internet from 0030\
  \ until the approximate time the vessel sank .  \nThis is not evidence that he was\
  \ actively using the mobile phone, as some mobile applications \ncause phone s to\
  \ be connected to the internet i n the background.  \n4.2.5.  Someone who was asleep\
  \ or distracted by using a mobile phone would have been  less likely to \nnotice\
  \ any unusual attitude or movement of the vessel as it was taking on water.  \n\
  4.2.6.  Something alerted the crew to the developing situation.  This could hav\
  \ e been an engine or \nhigh-level bilge alarm, or simply an extreme attitude or\
  \ motion of the vessel as it took on \nwater.  \n4.2.7.  At least one person was\
  \ awake to make an attempted mobile phone call to the sister vessel \nLegacy . \
  \ Also, the skipper made a mayday  radio call shortly before the vessel sank . However,\
  \  it \nwas not possible to establish wh ich, and for how long , crew member s had\
  \ been awake before \nthe vessel sank.  Equally, it was not possible to establish\
  \ what actions the crew took to remedy \nthe situation before  the vessel sank.\
  \  This is particularly important when considering the \npossible causes of the\
  \ sinking, as explained in the following sections.  \n4.2.8.  The Jubilee  had five\
  \ main watertight compartments .  These were the chain locker10, the \nforecastle\
  \ space11, the engine room, the aft compartment and the fish hold .  The fish hold\
  \ was \nthe only compartment large enough to on its own cause the vessel to sink\
  \ when flooded  (see \nFigure 2).  \n4.2.9.  All the watertight compartments except\
  \ the  fish hold were connected to the vessel's bilge \nsystem by piping that led\
  \ back to the engine  room.  These compartments each had: \n\uF0B7 high-level bilge\
  \ alarms that activated a light and an alarm in the wheelhouse  \n\uF0B7 bilges\
  \ that could be pumped out by manually opera ted valves connecting  the bilge to\
  \ \neither an engine -driven pump or an electric pump in  the engine  room  \n\uF0B7\
  \ the capability of being pumped manually using a hand pump located on the port12\
  \ \nside of the main deck.   \n                                                \
  \        \n10 A chain locker is a space in the forward part of a ship, usually beneath\
  \ the bow forward of the collision \nbulkhead , that contains the anchor chain and\
  \ rope and in small vessels other ropes . \n11 The forecastle space is the forward\
  \ part of a vessel containing the crew 's sleeping or living quarters . \n12 Port\
  \ is the left-hand s ide of a vessel when looking forward . \n\n<< Page 12 >>\n\

  \ vehicle  search for  the Jubilee ,  \nshowing the vessel  sitting upright on \
  \ the seabed  \n4.3. Possible or probable scenarios leading to the foundering  \n\
  Collision with a submerged object  \n4.3.1.  Hull damage was unlikely to have been\
  \ the cause of the sinking.  \n4.3.2.  For the hull to be pierced the vessel would\
  \ have had to have struck or been struck by an \nobject with considerable force\
  \  and there would have been visual evidence such as a hole, \nscraped paint  or\
  \ buck ling of the hull plates.   \n4.3.3.  The Jubilee  was constructed with a\
  \ steel hull and the dive survey showed it to be in good \ncondition.  As far as\
  \ could be ascertained , the hull was not damaged in any  way other than:  \n\uF0B7\
  \ one of the bilge keels had been slightly crushed, most likely when the vessel\
  \ came to  \nrest on the seabed  \n\uF0B7 one of the stabiliser s13, on which the\
  \ vessel was resting, was slightly bent, as was the \nstabiliser's strut . \n4.3.4.\
  \  The Jubilee  and the other vessels in the Ocean Fisheries fleet were  fitted\
  \ with commercial \nsatellite tracking system s, TracPlus, by the operator.  The\
  \ operator usually receive d hourly \n                                         \
  \               \n13 Stabilisers are fins mounted below the waterline and emerging\
  \ laterally from the hull to reduce a vessel's \nroll due to wind or waves. They\
  \ can usually be retracted by some means to allow the vessel to sit alongside a\
  \  \nwharf.  When extended they are held rigidly at an angle to the hull by the\
  \ struts that are mounted on the \nvessel's main deck   \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2015\
  \ -203 \n<< Page 13 >>\n position reports .  They could,  however , increase the\
  \ data -collection rate up to every five \nminutes if required.   \n4.3.5.  The\
  \ position information received from the Jubilee  preceding the sinking sh owed\
  \ that the \nvessel was drifting.  If the vessel had been  drifting , it would have\
  \ been  very unlikely to strike \nanything with enough force to pierce the hull.\
  \  \n4.3.6.  The dive survey carried out by the Commission did not show any significant\
  \ damage (see \nabove) to  the hull other than that which  occurred after the sinking.\
  \ There was no indication of \nany other vessels nearby  at the time of the foundering.\
  \  \nFinding  \n1. The Jubilee  sinking was very unlikely to have been caused by\
  \ fishing \noperations, collision with any object or a leaking propeller shaft seal\
  \ . \n \nFlooding of the engine room  \n4.3.7.  Flooding of the engine room was\
  \ unlikely to have been the cause of the vessel sinking.  \n4.3.8.  Calculation\
  \ s show ed that even if  the engine room had been  totally flooded with water,\
  \ the \nvessel would not have sunk  and would still have  had positive stability.\
  \  However, the free \nsurfac e14 effect of a partially filled engine compartment\
  \ would have reduce d the stability of \nthe vessel , possibly  to a point where\
  \ a large wave might have cause d it to caps ize.  Therefore,  \nthis scenario is\
  \ considered further.  \n4.3.9.  The Commission  consider ed several possible mechanisms\
  \ for water entering the engine room:  \n\uF0B7 through a leaking propeller shaft\
  \ seal  (discounted - see the introduction to  the analysis \nabove)  \n\uF0B7 from\
  \ a damaged main engine cooling -water system  \n\uF0B7 back-flooding through the\
  \ bilge system  \n\uF0B7 flooding from a damaged seawater intake or  associated\
  \ pipework . \n4.3.10.  It was unlikely that damage to the main engine cooling system\
  \ caused the engine room to \nflood .  The main engine cooling system was a closed\
  \ system with keel coolers .  For the engine \nroom to flood through this system\
  \ , the keel coolers would have had to be holed at two points : \none outside the\
  \ hull and one within the engine room.   \n4.3.11.  The Commission was unable to\
  \ determine from t he surveys of the sunken vessel whether \nthere was damage to\
  \ the keel coolers or the main sea suction.  However, the pipework in the \nengine\
  \ room  was in good condition , and if water had entered the engine room bilge it\
  \ would \nhave been automatic ally pumped ou t by the  submersible pump in the engine\
  \ room .  If water \nhad been  entering the engine room from this source and the\
  \  rate of ingress had exceeded the \ncapacity of the submersible pump , the high-level\
  \ bilge alarm would  have sounded and alerted \nthe crew at an e arly stage.  Therefore,\
  \  the Commission consider ed it very unlik ely that the \nsinking was attributable\
  \ to a damaged cooling -water system . \n4.3.12.  Back flooding into the engine\
  \ room through the bilge system was unlikely to have caused the \nsinking.  The\
  \ engine -driven water pump ran continuously when the engine was running and \n\
  \                                                        \n14 Free surface effect\
  \ is a change in the stability of a vessel caused by liquids moving about freely\
  \ in a tank or \nhold. As a vessel rolls, liquids in the tanks or breached compartments\
  \ accentuate the roll by moving freely \nfrom side to side of the tank s, accumulating\
  \ first on one side and then the  other, and may adversely affect \nthe stability\
  \ of the ship. The free service effect can be reduced by having baffles in a tank\
  \ to reduce the free \nmovement or by either emptying the tank or filling it complete\
  \ ly (USLegal, 2016) . \n\n<< Page 14 >>\n Final Report MO -2015 -203 was normally\
  \ configured to suck from the sea and discharge  through a pipe and hose on the\
  \ \nmain deck  that was led over -side through one of the scuppers .  Divers confirmed\
  \ that the \nengine -driven pump was set up in this normal configuration .  Therefore,\
  \  water could not  have  \nback flood ed through this pump because it was n ot\
  \ connected to the bilge system , nor could \nthe water have been discharged into\
  \ the fish hold (see Figure 5).  \n4.3.13.  However, F igure 5 shows a potential\
  \ path for water  to have  back -flooded  through the bilge \nsystem and enter ed\
  \ the engine room  via the electric -driven pump.  \n4.3.14.  The electrically driven\
  \ water pump only ran when manually switched o n.  It discharged through \npiping\
  \ that ran overhead along the roof of the weatherproof shelter to a valve and hose\
  \ at the \naft end.  The dive surveys  confirmed  that: \n\uF0B7 the pump switch\
  \ was in the on position  \n\uF0B7 the inlet valve on the pump system was set to\
  \ bilge suction  \n\uF0B7 the discharge valve on the pump system was set to discharge\
  \ through the \ndeck piping.   \n\uF0B7 The valve at the aft end of the weatherproof\
  \ shelter was set to open  \n\uF0B7 the valve on the bilge suction manifold was\
  \ set to draw (suck) from the engine \nroom bilge.   \n4.3.15.  If the pump had\
  \ not been  running and the end of the hose had been  in the water, there was \n\
  potential for water to siphon back into the engine room bilge .  However,  it would\
  \ have taken a \nvery strong siphon suction to draw water high enough and through\
  \ the pipework , which ran \nalong the roof of the deck shelter  about 2.5 m above\
  \ the waterline and then through  a non - \nsea valve  \nstrainer  \nelectric pump\

  \ scenario.  T he engine room bilge non -return \nvalve was recovered from the vessel.\
  \  When tested it was found to leak back a small amount \nunder mains water pressure.\
  \  T he amount siphoned back would have been very small due to \nthe constriction\
  \ of the non -return valve ; another non -return  valve was located at the end of\
  \ the \nbilge suction pipe that would have also sto pped or restricted any siphoning\
  \ .  Any water \npotentially entering the engine room would automatically have been\
  \ pumped overboard and a \nbilge alarm sounded in the wheelhouse.  \n4.3.16.  The\
  \ setting of the electric -driven water pump to suck from the engine room bilge\
  \ w as unusual.  \nInterviews with other crew who had worked on the Jubilee  confirmed\
  \ this.  As already \nmentioned, t he engine room bilge was serviced by a separate\
  \ automatic submersible bilge \npump with its own separate discharge pipe.  Any\
  \ water collecting in th e bilge was \nautomatically pumped overboard without any\
  \ intervention by the crew.  Why the crew set this \nbilge pump to draw from the\
  \ engine room is unclear . \n4.3.17.  The a ctivation of the engine room high -level\
  \ bilge alarm would have been  one reason for \nsetting the bilge system to pump\
  \ from the engine room.  In the  following section we describe  \nwhy a flooding\
  \ of the fish hold was the most likely reason for the sinking .   \n4.3.18.  A flooded\
  \ fish hold  would have result ed in the vessel assuming a large trim16 by the stern.\
  \  A \nlarge stern trim  would  have  cause d any residual water lying in the engine\
  \ room bilge to run to  \nthe aft end of the bilge where the high -level bilge alarm\
  \ was located , which could  have cause d \nthe high-level bilge  alarm to sound\
  \ in the wheelhouse , even if the  quantity of water were  small .  \nA crew member\
  \ would have naturally inves tigate d the cause of such an  alarm  and ma de \n\
  preparations to pump the bilge .   \n4.3.19.  A crew member would have been  required\
  \  to enter the engine room to set the bilge system to \ndraw from the e ngine room\
  \ bilge .  If there had been  very little water in the engine room, this \nshould\
  \ have been obvious to him at the time.   Nevertheless, there would have been  good\
  \  \nreason to leave  the configuration of the bilge pumping arrangement  to draw\
  \ from the engine \nroom .  A large trim by the stern is indicative of the vessel\
  \ taking water in the fish hold.  The \nengine room bilge system could not have\
  \ been used to pump out the fish hold, so it would \nhave made good sense to leave\
  \ the bilge syste m set to draw from the engine room in case it \ntoo started flooding.\
  \  \n4.3.20.  Notwithstanding that the bilge arrangement was found set to draw from\
  \ the engine room bilge, \nthe main reason s for discounting engine room flooding\
  \ as the cause of the sinking were : \n\uF0B7 even with the engine room fully flooded,\
  \ the vessel would not have sunk and would still \nhave had positive stability \
  \ \n\uF0B7 the early warning that the bilge alarm w ould have given the crew would\
  \ have given  them \nample time to raise the alarm and take corrective action .\
  \ \nFinding  \n2. The Jubilee  sinking was unlikely to have been caused by flooding\
  \ of the engine \nroom, although it could not be ruled out as a contributing factor\
  \ . \n \n                                                        \n15 A non -return\
  \ valve is a valve that will only let a fluid pass in one direction . \n16 Trim\
  \ is the difference between the dra ught  forward and the dra ught  aft. Dra ught\
  \ is the depth of a hull \nbelow the water.   If the aft draught  is greater, the\
  \ vessel is descr ibed as being trimmed by the stern ; if the \nforward dra ught\
  \  is greater, the vessel  is trimmed by the bow .  A large or excessive trim, caused\
  \ by excess \nweight forward or aft, will reduce the freeboard forward or aft, will\
  \ change the vessel 's condition from the \ndesigned seagoing trim and may affect\
  \ the seakeeping characteristics of the vessel .   \n\n<< Page 16 >>\n Final Report\

  \  It was likely that the Jubilee  sank due to t he fish hold being flooded.  T\
  \ his was the only space \nthat could,  alone , have cause d the Jubilee  to sink,\
  \ even  before the hold was completely full of \nwater.   \n4.3.22.  If the fish\
  \ hold had filled with water , the stability of the vessel would have been  reduced\
  \ due to \nthe effect of free surface and the raising of the virtual centre of gravity.\
  \  As the stability \nreduced the vessel would  have  become more susceptible to\
  \ rolling and potentially capsizing \nby a large wave.  \n4.3.23.  A naval architect\
  \ calculated the stability of the vessel for several operating condition s as \n\
  required under Maritime Rules Part 40D.  After the accident this naval architect\
  \ produced a \nreport showing possible gradual flooding scenarios for the two major\
  \ spaces, the fish hold and \nthe engine room, and the effect s of the aft space\
  \ being flooded with water (see Appendix 2).  \nThese flooding calculations have\
  \ been verified by the Commission.   \n4.3.24.  The calculations carried out by\
  \ the naval architect showed that the fish hold only needed to be \nbetween 60%\
  \ and 7 0% full before down -flooding17 occurred  into o ther compartments .  Down\
  \ -\nflooding would occur through unsecured openings in the deck or the superstructure\
  \  and would \ncause the vessel to sink by the stern . \nDuring the post -accident\
  \ dive surveys it could not be determined whether the watertight hatch \ninto the\
  \ aft compartment  (see Figure 2) was secured.  If it were  not secure , water would\
  \ have \nentered this space as the vessel trimmed  by the stern.  In that scenario\
  \ the Jubilee  would have \nlost positive  stability when the fish hold was only\
  \ about 40% flooded (see Appendix 2).  \nHow could water have entered the fish hold?\
  \  \n4.3.25.  It was unlikely that seawater from wave action on deck was the main\
  \ contributor  to the \nsinking.  When the Jubilee  first entered service it was\
  \ known to be 'wet on deck '.  However, t he \nfreeing ports18 had been successfully\
  \ modified to reduce the amount of seawater washing \nonto the deck.  Despite these\
  \ modifications the sea conditions during the night would normally \nhave resulted\
  \ in some water on deck.   \n4.3.26.  There were two hatches leading t o the fish\
  \ hold.   The main and larger of the two  hatches \nopened upwards  from  a raised\
  \ coaming19 that extended 300 millimetre s (mm)  above deck  \nlevel.  It  was positioned\
  \ further forward under the weatherproof cover .  The  RNZN dive team \nfound that\
  \ the main hatch (see Figure 2) was closed but not secured.  As it could not  be\
  \ \nestablished what actions the crew took after discovering their plight, it is\
  \ not possible to say \nwhether this hatch was open during the night.  Neverthe\
  \ less, given its position and the height \nof the coaming it would have been  unlikely\
  \ to flood in anything but exceptional seas . \n4.3.27.  The smaller fish hatch\
  \ was located further aft and in a position more exposed to the weather.  \nIt was\
  \ not fitted with a coaming, b ut instead it was flush with the deck  and opened\
  \ downwards \ninto the fish hold .  It had a protective coaming constructed around\
  \ it, but this had drain ports \nthat allowed water to drain from or enter the coa\
  \ ming.  When the RNZN dive team carried out \nthe init ial dives to recover the\
  \ crew they found that the fish hatch (see Figure s 2 and 10 ) \nappeared to be\
  \ closed flush with the deck.  Again, because  it could not  be established what\
  \ \nactions the crew took after discovering their plight, it is not possible to\
  \ say whether this hatch \nwas open during the night.  \n4.3.28.  The fish hatch\
  \ was not fitted with a latching mechanism.  It relied on hydraulic pressure in\
  \ the \nclosing ram to keep it closed and sealed.  If the hydraulic pump had not\
  \ been operating and \nthe pressure in the h ydraulic cylinder had reduced for whatever\
  \ reason (such as a minor \n                                                   \

  \ of an undamaged vessel due to \nheel, trim, or submergence of the vessel  \n18\
  \ A freeing port is an opening in the bottom of a bulwark for rapid drainage of\
  \ a weather deck in heavy seas . \n19 A coaming is any vertical surface on a vessel\
  \ that is designed to deflect or prevent the entry of water. \nUsually it refers\
  \ to a raised section of deck plating around an opening, such as a hatch. Coamings\
  \ also \nprovide a frame onto which a hatch cover can be fitted . \n\n<< Page 18\
  \ >>\n Final Report MO -2015 -203 hydraulic leak) , the hatch may have  open ed\
  \ slightly , allowing ingress of water .  This is a safety \nissue that the owner\
  \ has addressed on vessels constructed after the Jubilee . \n4.3.29.  The fish hatch\
  \ could be opened and closed simply by operating buttons in  the wheelhouse, but\
  \ \nit was not easily observable from the wheelhouse.  In the past it had been inadvertently\
  \ left \nopen on completion of fishing.   However, even if the hatch had been i\
  \ nadvertently left open \nduring the night, it is unlikely that seawater from wave\
  \ action on  the deck alone could  have  \nenter ed the fish hold in sufficient\
  \ quantity to overwhelm the capacity of the automatic bilge \npump located in the\
  \ fish hold  unless it was bl ocked .   \n4.3.30.  The fish hold bilge was fitted\
  \ with a submersible electric pump that was controlled by a float \nswitch.  The\
  \ pump discharged directly overboard through its own dedicated pipework.  It is\
  \ \npossible that water from a hose supplied by one of the vessel 's fire and bilge\
  \ pumps in the \nengine room exceed ed the capacity of this pump .  This had happened\
  \ on the previous voyage  \nwith a different crew .  The crew had been using the\
  \ deck wash hose to help wash the fish into \nthe fish hold from the chute between\
  \ the fish table and the fish hatch.  The deck wash hose \nhad been left running\
  \ and the fish hatch left open .  The fish hold had begun  to fill with water \n\
  because the capacity of the deck wash pump was greater than the capacity of the\
  \ bilge pump  \nin the fish hold .  The crew had identified the problem and stopped\
  \ the electrically driven deck \nwash pump , after which  the fish hold bilge pump\
  \  had cleared the water.  \n4.3.31.  The Commission received anecdotal evidence\
  \ that the fish hold had flooded on another \noccasion for similar reasons.  However,\
  \ the owner and operators were unaware of this as it \nhad not been reported to\
  \ them or to the relevant authorities.  \n4.3.32.  The electric deck wash pump was\
  \ located in the engine room, close to the wheelhouse and \ncrew sleeping quarters.\
  \  It  is difficult to know whether the noise it made  when running would \nhave\
  \ been noticeable  to the crew , or distinguishable above all the other noise s\

  \ bilge pump was retrieved from the vessel for further \ntesting.  The testing (\
  \ Figure 11 showed that the pump was not blocked and appeared to be in \ngood working\
  \ order.  The impeller could be rotated by hand.  However, it was not possible to\
  \ \ntest the fish hold bilge pipe to check if it was blocked.   \n4.3.35.  Divers\
  \ found t he electrically driven deck w ash pump hose end over the side of the vessel.\
  \   If \nthe hose from the electric driven pump had been  left running into the\
  \ fish hold, and assuming \nthat the fish hold automatic bilge pump had been  working\
  \ and not blocked, the time it would \nhave taken to fill the fish hold enough to\
  \ sink the vessel correspond ed closely with the time \nbetween the crew \"parking\
  \ up for the night\" and the distress radio call being made.    \n4.3.36.  It was\
  \ about as likely as not tha t this was the main source of water accumulating in\
  \ the fish \nhold.  However, t here are two variables or caveats to this hypothesis\
  \ . \n4.3.37.  First, as mentioned above, the electric -driven pump in the engine\
  \ room was found configured  \nto draw from the engine room bil ge - not from the\
  \ main seawater suction, as it would have to \nhave been for it to pump water into\
  \ the fish hold.  The crew would have to have reconfigured \nthe pump from supplying\
  \ water to the fish hold to drawing from the engine room bilge once \nthe problem\
  \ was discovered.  \n4.3.38.  Secondly, the fish hatch was found by divers to be\
  \ closed flush with the deck.  Either the hatch \nhad been open and then closed\
  \ by the crew when the problem was discovered, or the hose \nhad been  left through\
  \ the main fish hold hatch, which th e divers found closed but not secured.  \n\
  4.3.39.  The fish hold bilge was not fitted with a bilge alarm and there was no\
  \ visual alarm at the \nsteering position in the wheelhouse to indicate when the\
  \ pump was operating.  The absence of \na visual alarm  was a serious safe ty issue\
  \ and was contrary to Maritime Rules Part 40(D).28 \n(6)(d) (see Appendix 3).  \n\
  4.3.40.  Bilge alarms in spaces that frequently have water in them due to normal\
  \ operations are \nproblematic.  Repetitive or 'nuisance' alarms are distracting\
  \ for crew , and crew have been \nknown to silence or bypass them.  In such spaces,\
  \ the installation of a second bilge alarm \nmounted higher in the compartment is\
  \ a good defence against abnormal quantities of wat er \naccumulating in the space.\
  \  Since the accident t he Jubilee 's owner has installed such alarms \nin the fish\
  \ holds of its other fishing vessels.  \n\n<< Page 22 >>\n Final Report MO -2015\
  \ -203 Figure 11 \nShore -based examination of the recovered electric bilge pump\
  \ from the fish hold  \nFinding s \n3. It was likely that flooding of the Jubilee\
  \ 's fish hold was the main factor \ncontributing to it s sinking , or capsizing\
  \ and sinking . \n4. It was about as likely as not that the cause of the fish hold\
  \ flooding was water \nfrom a deck wash hose that had been left running through\
  \ an open hatch .  \n5. The rate of water from the deck  wash hose exceeded the\
  \ pumping rate of the \nautomatic submersible bilge pump in the fish hold.  \n6.\
  \ The fish hatch was susceptible to being left fully or partially open because it\
  \ \nwas hydraulically closed from the wheelhouse and could not be latched closed.\
  \  \n7. The bilge pumping system on the Jubilee  was not fitted with any means of\
  \ \nautomatically alerting the crew when the water in the fish hold reached an \n\
  abnormal level.  If the crew had been alerted to the level of water in the fish\
  \ \nhold, it is as likely as not  that the sinking would have been prevented.  \
  \ \n8. The absence of a visual indicator in the wheelhouse that would have alerted\
  \  \nthe crew  when the bilge pump was running meant that the bilge pumping \nsystem\
  \ was non-complian t with Maritime Rules.  There was no other means \nfitted to\
  \ the fish hold bilge system to alert the crew to excess water in the fish \nhold.\
  \   \n4.4. Why were the crew unable to escape from the wheelhouse?  \n4.4.1.  The\
  \ skipper and crew of the Jubilee  were aware that they were in trouble .  They\
  \ tri ed to \ntelephone the Legacy  but the call was n ot answered.  The Commission\
  \ was unable to \nestablish why the call was made.  Almost immediately after this\
  \ the skipper issued a distress \ncall saying they were taking on water and then\
  \ said they were \"getting off  and getting in the \nliferaft now\" .  This was\
  \ the last transmission received.  \n\n \nFinal Report MO -2015 -203 \n<< Page 23\
  \ >>\n 4.4.2.  It could not be established when and for how long the crew were aware\
  \ of their predicament.   \nAs discussed above , one of the crew was fully clothed\
  \ and the other two were dressed i n what \nwas probably sleeping attire .   \n\
  Means of escape  \n4.4.3.  The majority of small New Zealand fishing vessels, especially\
  \ those of older design, usually \nhave  easy exits from the wheelhouse, either\
  \ through a door to the starboard21 or port side or \nthrough an open ing window.\
  \   \n4.4.4.  On the Jubilee  the only direct exit from the wheelhouse was aft through\
  \ the sl iding wheelhouse \ndoor onto the m ain deck .  The main deck  was covered\
  \ for the majority of its length by a \nweatherproof shelter.  To reach the liferaft\
  \ the crew would  have had to either turn hard right \nand go through the door on\
  \ the port side leading out to the foredeck, or move aft and climb \nthe ladder\
  \ to the top of the shelter deck22 roof.  \n4.4.5.  It could not be established\
  \ whether the Jubilee  simply sank by the stern or cap sized first and \nthen sank.\
  \  The behaviour of a sinking vessel is difficult to predict, as there are so many\
  \ \nvariables in buoyancy and stability, depending on which compartments are flooded\
  \ and in \nwhat order.  \n4.4.6.  Whatever happened  occurred  quickly , because\
  \ all three crew members were trapped inside \nthe wheelhouse with the sliding door\
  \ leading on  to the main deck shut.  One panel that closed \noff the compartment\
  \ where the lifejackets were stowed was dislodged, possibly indicative of \nthe\
  \ crew attempting to don lifejackets before abandoning the vessel.  When the crew\
  \ were \nrecovered, none of them was wearing  a lifejacket.   \n4.4.7.  The design\
  \ of the wheelhouse did not afford ample opportunity for escape.  With t he vessel\
  \ \nsinking by the stern, the option of escape onto the roof of the shelter deck\
  \ would not have \nbeen  possible  (see Figure 6).  Even crossing to the port side\
  \ to access the foredeck would \nhave been difficult.  If the vessel capsized, opening\
  \ the heavy  sliding door would have been  \ndifficult, if not almost impossible.\
  \  \n4.4.8.  The other means of escape from the wheelhouse was via the emergency\
  \ escape through the \nforecastle accommodation.  Once in the forecastle accommodation\
  \ the crew would have had \nto remove a wo oden 'plug' in the forward bulkhead ,\
  \ which concealed a watertight hatch into \nthe chain locker space.  Once access\
  \ had been gained to the chain locker space the crew \nwould have had to open another\
  \  watertight hatch to access the vessel's foredeck.  \n4.4.9.  It was very unlikely\
  \ that the crew would have succeeded in escaping a sinking vessel by this \nroute,\
  \ which was designed for escape in the event of fire.  \n4.4.10.  Ensuring adequate\
  \ m eans of escape in any emergency on board a small vessel is a serious \nsafety\
  \ issue.  Designers need to consider as many scenarios as practicable and provide\
  \ \nsufficient alternatives for the crew to escape in any event.  The Jubilee 's\
  \ owner , which  also \nbuilt the vessel , has addressed this by providing better\
  \ means of escape in vessels built after \nthe Jubilee . \nDid the means of escape\
  \ comply with  the Maritime Rules?  \n4.4.11.  As part of the inquiry  the Commission\
  \ considered whether the alternative means of escape \nthrough the forecastle and\
  \ chain locker met the intent of the Maritime Rules.  \n4.4.12.  The watertight\
  \ hatches fitted between the forecastle accommodation and the chain locker, \nand\
  \ the chain locker and the open deck , were of identical construction.  They were\
  \ of a \nproprietary brand and gave a clear space opening of 18 inches by 24 inches\
  \ (457  mm by 610  \n                                                        \n\

  \ closed against the weather . \n\n<< Page 24 >>\n Final Report MO -2015 -203 mm)\
  \ (see Appendix 4) , which was 23% less than the standard clear opening area of\
  \ 600  mm \nby 600  mm23.   \n4.4.13.  The discrepancy in clear opening size was\
  \ noted by a naval architect of the company surveying \nthe construction of the\
  \ vessel, who in a letter to the company building the vessel said that:  \nThe clear\
  \ opening of the door does not meet the normal standard mi nimum \nopening of at\
  \ least 600 mm.  The attending surveyor is to satisfy himself that the \nproposed\
  \ opening of the hatch does not compromise the efficacy and safety of \nthe crew\
  \ in any event  \nThe attending surveyor considered that this was satisfactory and\
  \ the hatches were approved \nin accordance with Maritime Rule s Part 40(D).14 -\
  \ Hatchway openings and covers and other \ndeck openings , section (10)  (d) (see\
  \ Appendix 4).   \n \nFigure 12  \nWatertight hatch to the chain locker as fitted\

  \ hatches fitted to the Jubilee  between the forecastle space and the chain locker\
  \ and the \nchain locker and  the deck.   \n4.4.14.  Maritime Rule s Part 40(D)\
  \  Fire protection , paragraph 62 - Means of es cape (see Appendix 3) \nstates that:\
  \  \n(1) Where reasonable and practicable, and having regard to the number of \n\
  crew utilising the space and size of space, at least two means of escape, one of\
  \ \nwhich may be the normal means of access, as widely separated as pos sible, \n\
  must be provided from each section of accommodation and service spaces\u2026  \n\
  \                                                        \n23 The vessel was const\
  \ ructed under the original Maritime Rule, which came into force on 1 February 2001.\

  \ spaces below the \nopen deck must be arranged so that it is possible to reach\
  \ the open deck without \npassing through interv ening spaces containing a potential\
  \ source of fire.  \n(3)  The second means of escape may be through portholes, windows\
  \ or \nhatches of adequate size and preferably leading to the open deck.  \n4.4.15.\
  \  Although not defined in the Maritime Rules, Maritime New Zealand  stated:  \n\
  that the generally understood meaning of 'open deck ' is anywhere on a vessel \n\
  that is exposed and not within a weathertight or watertight area or within the \n\
  shelter deck area of a vessel .   \n4.4.16.  The means of escape from the forecastle\
  \ accommodation may not have met the intent of \nparagraph s 62(2) and (3) .  The\
  \ normal means of access to the accommodation space passed \nthrough the wheelhouse\
  \ and living quarters where a risk of fire existed.  The secondary means \nof escape\
  \ passed through the intervening chain locker space, rather than the 'preference'\
  \ of  \nleading directly to the open deck.   \n4.4.17.  The means of escape from\
  \ the wheelhouse may not have met  the intent of Maritime Rule s \n40(D).62 , paragraphs\
  \ 2 and 3.  The normal means of access to  the wheelhouse , through th e \naft sliding\
  \ door,  then passed through the \"shelter \" that covered the main deck before\
  \ it was \npossible to gain access to the open deck, and the secondary means of\
  \ escape passed through \ntwo intervening compartments before reaching the open\
  \ deck.   \n4.4.18.  Whether these means of access or escape met the intent of the\
  \ Maritime Rules would depend \non what was \"reasonable and practicable, and having\
  \ regard to the number of crew utilizing \nthe space and the sizes of the space\
  \ \" as specified in paragraph (1)  \n4.4.19.  Notwithstanding the Maritime Rules,\
  \ w hen designing or fitting a shelter -type structure that \ncovers an open deck\
  \ , the owner should use a risk -based approach to identify suitable means \nof\
  \ escape for the crew in an emergency.   \n4.4.20.  It is concerning  that the wheelhouse\
  \ , where the crew were found, where the y were  most likely \nto gather in an emergency\
  \ , and where the lifejackets were  stowed , had no escape  route  \ndirect ly to\
  \ the open deck.  \n4.4.21.  Certificates of compliance issued by safe ship management\
  \ companies show tha t the vessel s \nhave been assessed as complying with, at least,\
  \ the minimum standards required under the \nrules and regulations.  H owever, the\
  \ concept of safety management systems is that owners \nand operators should take\
  \ a risk -based approach to their operati ons.  Hazards must be \nidentified  and\
  \ risks must be assessed and reduced to as low as reasonably practicable to \nprevent\
  \ damage to property and harm to people.   This means that owners and operators\
  \ \ncannot rely solely on compliance with the minimum technical standards laid out\
  \ in maritime \nrules for meeting their obligations  under safety management systems\
  \ .   \n4.4.22.  The Maritime Rules do not give any guidance on what is , and what\
  \ is not,  an acceptable \nstandard , but leave the decision of acceptability to\
  \ surveyors ' discretion.  This creates \ninconsistency in application between surveyors\
  \ and also between surveyors and Maritime New \nZealand .  What may be acceptable\
  \ to one surveyor may not be acceptable to another or for \nthat matter to Maritime\
  \ New Zealand.   \n4.4.23.  Since the construction and certification of the vessel,\
  \ Maritime New Zealand has changed the \nsafety management system from the 'old'\
  \ safe ship management system to the 'new' \nMaritime Operators Safety System (MOSS).\
  \  This has allowed Maritime New Zealand to have \noversight of survey, audit and\
  \ construction requirements.  In the absence of guidelines, the \nDirector of Maritime\
  \ New Zealand can now give advice to ensure more consistency in \nacceptable standards.\
  \  \n4.4.24.  Maritime New Zealand has also formed a surveyors advisory grou p to\
  \ give advice to surveyors \nand monitor standards to achieve consistency in the\
  \ application of the Maritime Rules.   \n\n<< Page 26 >>\n Final Report MO -2015\
