Question:
I have a list of safety issues found in each accident investigation report.

Can you please read all of these and respond with a list of all the unique safety issues identified. Note that each the same safety issue may be written in a slightly differnet way.

For each unique safety issue can you add what reports it is found in.

The format should look like

- description: "abc"
  reports:
    - "2019_201"
    - etc

Question:
Please read this list of safety issues and provide a summary of the common trends and issues found. THis should be prose and not use any lists.

I would like your answer to be concise and only have about 300 words.

Here are some useful defintions:

Safety factor - Any (non-trivial) events or conditions, which increases safety risk. If they occurred in the future, these would
increase the likelihood of an occurrence, and/or the
severity of any adverse consequences associated with the
occurrence.

Safety issue - A safety factor that:
• can reasonably be regarded as having the
potential to adversely affect the safety of future
operations, and
• is characteristic of an organisation, a system, or an
operational environment at a specific point in time.
Safety Issues are derived from safety factors classified
either as Risk Controls or Organisational Influences.

Safety theme - Indication of recurring circumstances or causes, either across transport modes or over time. A safety theme may
cover a single safety issue, or two or more related safety
issues.
