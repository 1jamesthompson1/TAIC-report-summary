#### _A tool and webapp to support both investigators and researchers in understanding the collection of previous investigations_

## What

This is a Semantic Analysis project to look at the marine investigation reports made by the Transport accident investigation commission ([TAIC](https://www.taic.org.nz/)) in New Zealand.
There is only use of publicly available data and the reports will be summarised using a variety of techniques. The reports that will be looked can be found on TAIC's [website](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiries?order=field_publication_date_value&sort=desc&keyword=&date_filter%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&date_filter%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&publication_date%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&publication_date%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&status%5B0%5D=12).

The webapp demo can be found at https://taic-viewer-72e8675c1c03.herokuapp.com/. Information on how to use the webapp is found in the [wiki](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/wiki/How-you-can-use-this-program#webapp-user-instructions). The core of the project however is a python program that uses LLMs to read and provide summaries/analysis of the accident reports. More information about how the project works can be found [here](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/wiki/How-this-project-works).
