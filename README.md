# TAIC-report-summary

## What

This is a Meta Analysis project to look at the marine investigation reports made by the Transport accident investigation commission ([TAIC](https://www.taic.org.nz/)) in New Zealand.
There will be only use of publicly available data and the reports will be summarised using a variety of techniques. The reports that will be looked can be found on there [website](https://www.taic.org.nz/inquiries?order=field_publication_date_value&sort=desc&keyword=&date_filter%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&date_filter%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&publication_date%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&publication_date%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&status%5B0%5D=12).

This project is being completed as my final year Computer Science project for my BSc at Massey University.
There will be additional documents that will be submitted to Massey University as part of the project. All of these documents will be found in the [Uni Project document folder](/Uni%20project%20documents/).

## Goal

To be able to make meaningful connections between all the reports.

Currently the MVP is three fold:

- Engine that can read the reports and provide a summary of the Analysis and Findings sections. See [engine module](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/tree/main/engine)
- Viewer app that can help a user navigate and interpret the results from the engine. See [viewer app](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/tree/main/viewer)
- A 2 page report that can put togather all the findings that can be found from the output of the engine.
