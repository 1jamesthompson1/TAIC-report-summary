Retro-fitting of ETCS to locomotives is a significant task with limited available space and the safety critical nature of the ETCS equipment. A specific design is required for each new class fitted followed by prototype fitment, testing for safety assurance and then individual vehicle fitout and assurance testing. The cost and timeframe associated with this process is significant. Accordingly many factors need to be taken into consideration with respect to retro fitting of old locomotives. These include:_x000D_
â€¢	KiwiRail is currently installing ETCS to 53 DL class locomotives. First prototype is expected to be delivered in 2024_x000D_
â€¢	All new locomotives purchased for mainline running on the KiwiRail network are designed to be ETCS ready_x000D_
â€¢	Any new locomotives intended for mainline running in the Auckland suburban area will be fitted with ETCS at factory â€“ currently this includes the fitment of 20 DM class locomotives destined for North Island operations_x000D_
â€¢	DC and DH classes will be retired over the next five or so years. We are now primarily using DLâ€™s on the Port duty (which will be fitted with ETCS) and will be transferring DSGâ€™s into Auckland for the Westfield local shunts (Penrose / Sylvia Park etc.) We still have to work through a strategy of ETCS but it has been discussed in relation to the class.",

Their response addressed two parts of the recommendation separately. The first part of their response related to Gliding New Zealand review how gliding club instructors are trained:_x000D_
_x000D_
Gliding New Zealand is pleased to report that this recommendation was accepted and implemented. More than just review how gliding club instructors are trained GNZ undertook a comprehensive update and rewrite of the instructor training programme (ITP) and submitted this to the CAA for acceptance on 1st June 2021. A further period of extensive collaboration and engagement with the CAA was then undertaken before final acceptance of the updated ITP was received from the CAA on 19th October 2022. A summary of this fully reviewed and updated programme can be found at the link below._x000D_
https://gliding.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ITP-Summary.pdf_x000D_
_x000D_
Since acceptance, a GNZ team led by the Operations Team has been rolling out the updated ITP to club instructors around the country via a series of seminars to ensure a consistent approach to training using the new system is being adopted._x000D_

In addition, it should be noted that there has also been a new publication on the traps of ridge flying, ""10 Traps"", which was written and issued as a direct response to this accident. This document has been added to the Pilot Training Program to sharpen awareness around the potential hazards of ridge flying and is available to both pilots and instructors._x000D_
_x000D_
The second part of the President of GNZ response related to how GNZ audits its affiliated clubs:_x000D_
_x000D_
Gliding New Zealand advises that this recommendation is Under Consideration._x000D_
_x000D_
Club audits are currently conducted by GNZ Regional Operations Officers (ROOâ€™s) following a templated format. ROOâ€™s are volunteers and club audits in their present format can take an entire weekend for one club. Presently there are three ROOâ€™s covering 19 clubs spread across the length of New Zealand. To extend these audits to detect gaps in an instructorâ€™s knowledge would involve the systematic assessment of every instructor by the auditor, which is simply not practical, hence the auditor does rely on the club CFI to attest to each instructorâ€™s knowledge, capability and to provide evidence of competency via records of assessment, Form OPS 07 and Form OPS 09. _x000D_
_x000D_
To step up another level in auditing would require funding. GNZ notes that CASA in Australia funds their recreational aviation organisations to carry out their duties, recognising that by doing so they are saving CASA significant amounts of money in comparison to what it would cost CASA to do this themselves. GNZ suggest that the CAA instead of charging Part 149 recreational aviation organisations (which reduces their budgets available for use on safety measures such as audits) CAA should follow overseas best practice and fund these organisations to carry out audits and thus improve safety.",

(001/23),The Commission recommended thatÂ the Secretary of Transport review and revise Civil Aviation Rule Part 91 to mandate the wearing of pilot restraint harnesses during critical phases of commercial balloon flights. (001/23),,"You have asked how I intend to respond to this recommendation. In accordance with the terminology used by the Commission, I advise that the recommendation is â€œUnder considerationâ€. This is because as noted in the Ministryâ€™s response of 7 December 2022 to the Commissionâ€™s draft recommendation, all the four operators involved in this activity are already implementing the recommendations put forward by the Commission, and that the operatorsâ€™ safety management systems requires the wearing of pilot restraints. The Ministry believes that adequate steps are already in place to address the Commissionâ€™s recommendations. Furthermore, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has agreed to monitor voluntary compliance for a period of time and use that information to form an evidenced view on whether the residual risk alluded to in paragraph 5.11 of the Commissionâ€™s draft report continues to exist. If it does, then an amendment to Civil Aviation Rules might be justified._x000D_
As you will appreciate, the development of Civil Aviation Rules is undertaken together with the CAA.

KiwiRail is working with the industry to get the message out. With regard to provisions being made for the practicable requirements of non-static or short term work locations, the annual permit for road markings could cover this. It is worth noting that this is not something new. The annual/global permits have been available for several years. The applying company would need to satisfy KiwiRailâ€™s safety requirements and have a safety guide which documents the process when working under the annual permit regarding the activity agreed upon._x000D_

The Transport Accident Investigation Commission (Commission) has recommended to the Director of Maritime NZ:

""That they ensure all operators working under Maritime Rules Part 82 have identified on each jet boat all systems that are critical to the safe operation of the boat, and have documented inspection and maintenance systems in place that cover those critical systems and also ensure they meet manufacturers' specifications . The inspection and maintenance system should complement rather than replace any existing system of daily checks.""

The Commission has asked Maritime NZ to confirm whether these final recommendations will be implemented. The Commission has also asked, if practicable, the date by when these recommendations will be fully implemented and the likely actions taken to address the recommendations.

Maritime NZ's response to recommendation 10/19

Maritime NZ agrees with this recommendation. Maritime Rules Part 82 (Part 82) sets safe design and construction standards for jet boats, sets standards for safety equipment, and establishes safe operating procedures that must
be followed by commercial jet boat operators and drivers. Maritime NZ believe these provisions in Part 82 can ensure the safety issues identified in the recommendation are addressed.

Part 82 sets out that a commercial jet boat operator must have, and apply, a maintenance programme for every commercial jet boat and propulsion unit. This maintenance programme must be documented. Part 82 also outlines the types of hazards that must be managed by a commercial jet boat operator. This is not limited to only hazards relating to operating conditions or driver performance. Hazards relating to systems that are critical to the safe operation of the boat can be identified and managed by the operator.

Maritime NZ is currently developing a programme to extend areas within an operation that are audited under Part 82 requirements. The audits will be covering a wide range of topics but will specifically cover two key items:

The adequacy of the driver competency programmes required by the rule, and checking that they have been properly implemented by each operation .

The adequacy of the maintenance programmes required by the rule, and checking that they have been properly implemented by each operation.

As part of this programme of work Maritime NZ is also exploring working with commercial jet boat operators to develop critical systems maintenance guidance. From time to time Maritime NZ will issue Safety Updates to make operators aware of safety issues. There fore, in relation to this incident, Maritime NZ is developing a Safety Update to raise awareness of the potential risk of failure of studs which hold the steering nozzle housing in place and the requirements as part of their regular maintenance programme to check these parts. It is our intention to issue this Safety Update in 2020.",

Rather, they are factual determinations made by TAIC, elements of which DWNZ does not agree with.

The construction of Dong Won 701

DWNZ is not alone in operating vessels built to previous construction standards. We understand that essentially very few deep sea vessels in New Zealand are new vessels.

Construction rules are in a state of constant change due to new materials, construction methods and design. Owners of vessels are not required or expected to meet the new standards every time a rule changes. Rather they are encouraged to take a performance based approach and take what practicable and reasonable steps they can to meet the intent of the new rule. Rules allow for this internationally right across shipping.

Response to the fire

DWNZ does not agree that there is a proper factual basis for saying that the crew were delayed in being alerted to the fire or that an opportunity was missed. The fire occurred in port. DWNZ procedure, as per common industry practice, is for the crew to attempt a first response and raise the alarm with FENZ. If the first response fails, the crew then evacuate the vessel and await FENZ. Unlike most, if not all, other New Zealand deep sea commercial fishing operators, DWNZ trained all of their crew members to some degree in fire-fighting. This is well in excess of any regulatory compliance requirement. Other operators generally only train those in a designated response team, which would mean a minority of the crew. The fact the crew staged an unsuccessful first response and, despite that, then assembled a fire team to try to contain the fire is to their credit. The action of the first responders in leaving the burning cabin door open may not have been a conscious decision and they may not, in any event, have been able to shut it.

Accordingly, DWNZ does not agree that the first two paragraphs of 007/19 should be published, given they are not part of TAICâ€™s recommendation.

DWNZ recognised some of the challenges of fire safety on board their vessels and prior to the incident had installed improved detection systems on all their vessels. Immediately following the incident, DWNZ management took significant steps in directing a third party review of their entire vessel safety management systems. Many of the action points arising from the review align with the TAIC recommendation. In the intervening period, many action points have been completed and there is a process of ongoing continuous improvement to address safety issues across a range of issues on board including asset management, training and procedural development.

Accordingly, we are instructed that DWNZ will implement what it understands to be TAICâ€™s recommendation (paragraph 3 of 007/19), but, as explained above, DWNZ has already implemented measures which align with that recommendation. We explain this below in more detail.

Actions taken by DWNZ after the incident

Paragraphs 32 â€“ 34 of our letter dated 2 September 2019 set out the steps DWNZ took after the incident. We provide further detail below.

Safety management system

Immediately after the incident, the CEO and senior management of DWNZ conducted an internal investigation of the circumstances surrounding the incident, what lessons could be learned and what improvements could be made.

Management directed a complete review of the corporate HSE management system and its implementation. DWNZ considered that the existing regulatory mandated and audited Marine Operator Safety System (MOSS) was not effective in managing the hazards present. DWNZ engaged a third-party organisation specialising in commercial fishing vessels to conduct the review, develop a better MOSS safety management system and follow up with an implementation and training programme.

The new system was trialled on the DWNZ vessel Dong Won 519 starting in January 2019. Following a second review, the system was issued to the Dong Won 530 in September 2019. The system included new corporate policies, procedures, standard operating instructions and training / competence processes.

Vessel inspections and crew competence assessments

In parallel with the development of their safety management system, DWNZ also
organised independent third-party specialists to carry out a series of inspections and assessments of Dong Won 519 and Dong Won 530. These assessments considered safety issues including: fire prevention, containment and escalation control, watertight integrity and vessel stability, and factory and machinery safety.

The assessment and inspections included:

- at-sea operational assessments, conducted by a specialist with industry experience sailing on board;
- preâ€“dock inspection: an inspection of the vessel with a safety system focus in order to identify an assessment of the condition of the vessel and improvements to be made;
- attendance on board during dry dock and maintenance periods: identifying further possible improvements, conducting crew training and verifying corrective actions; and
- conducting in-port emergency drills.

Each vesselâ€™s hazard register was developed with the results risk assessed for controls. Inspections and assessments included contingency drills conducted on board followed up by a debrief, assessment and corrective action follow up. Recommendations from these assessments and inspections were considered for risk level and prioritised accordingly for action. Recommendations include actions in regard of the vessel, procedures and personnel training /competence.

Specific actions to date

We have attached, as Appendix 1 [see Appendix 4 of report], a comprehensive list of the actions taken by DWNZ following the incident. Most of these have been implemented and there is a process in place for ongoing improvement, hazard identification, corrective action and verification of controls.",

Maritime New Zealand is undertaking a review of Maritime Rules Part 40 Series, which is intended to address this issue definitely. Maritime New Zealand will, in the meantime, continue to work with vessel owners, operators and surveyors to adopt an approach to the pre-post 2004 concept in a way that seeks to achieve safe standards.

The 40 Series Reform is a long-term, collaborative project that intends to ensure that the rules for design, construction and equipment for domestic (non-SOLAS) ships are fit for purpose. Maritime NZ is working actively with the sector to ensure that survey and oversight of vessels continues under the existing law pending the outcome of the reform project.

Because of the scale of the reform being undertaken in this project, Maritime NZ believes the new rules, if accepted by the Minister, would likely come into effect in 2023.

As maritime rule amendments take some time Maritime NZ is proposing to undertake work within the next 12 months to provide further interim guidance to industry on this issue.",

This, in combination with the non-adherence to other aspects of the policies and procedures leading up to this grounding, is an indication that the procedural failures may not have been confined to this one accident, and that the operator will need to review the standard of navigation under pilotage for all its crews to ensure that industry good practice is being followed.

On 26 June 2019, the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Maersk Line A/S that they review the implementation of the companyâ€™s safety management system across its fleet with respect to navigation and pilotage, and take the necessary steps to ensure a high standard is achieved by all crews on all its ships.","the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Maersk Line A/S that they review the implementation of the companyâ€™s safety management system across its fleet with respect to navigation and pilotage, and take the necessary steps to ensure a high standard is achieved by all crews on all its ships.","The bridge operations on board the Leda Maersk fell short of achieving good industry practice in both planning and executing the passage under pilotage and bridge resource management.

On 26 June 2019, ","1. Maersk Line has identified that training of ship staff is of utmost importance to ensure effective implementation of company procedures and for ensuring safety of navigation, including navigation in pilotage waters. In this regard following measures have been taken:
- All navigators must undergo mandatory ECDIS training by Seagull A/S
- Already commenced in 2019.
- Aim is to enhance knowledge of navigators and to ensure optimum use of ECDIS as a tool.
- This will be followed up by refresher training at two year intervals so that navigators remain up to date.
- Further, all navigators are required to undergo Bridge Team Enhancement Programme Training.
- The programme focusses on improved bridge team work and optimum use of bridge resources.
- In bridge simulator phase of this course navigating officers are put through scenarios which replicate navigation incidents that occur during coastal and pilotage waters.
- As we employ over three thousand navigating officers, this process is being undertaken in a phased manner and will be completed in the year 2025.

2. Company procedures pertaining to navigation and use of ECDIS have been revised recently. This has been done so that navigators find them easier to understand, which in turn will increase adherence to these procedures. Overview of revised SMS procedures is attached herewith.

In accordance with the ISM code internal audit is carried out annually to verify compliance with the requirements of the Safety Management System. [These include navigation audits by a superintendent.] [The] last internal audit for Leda Maersk was conducted in Feb 2019.",

On 21 February 2019 ","The CAA undertook its own investigation into this crash and subsequently successfully prosecuted the operator for not taking all practicable steps to ensure the safety of its pilot and his passengers. Participants in the aviation system have a responsibility to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and this operator failed to do that.

The CAA investigation also identified that its safety oversight of this operator in the period leading up to the accident â€“ particularly during the period 2010-2012 â€“ didnâ€™t meet its own standards. In summary, it lacked the rigour demanded by its policies and procedures.

The analysis of those shortcomings was conducted in early 2017 and it was concluded that the work already underway to improve the CAAâ€™s regulatory performance (the start of which is referred to by the Commission in its recommendation) was addressing the deficiencies observed in the dealings with this operator. Since initiating that work in mid-2013 the CAA has made significant changes to improve its regulatory performance and oversight of aviation system participants, and this work continues. Significant capability building initiatives have been implemented and further initiatives will continue to be progressed as the CAA works to further enhance its performance and regulatory oversight. As a result of the work undertaken to date, and that currently in progress, the CAA of 2019 is a much more effective regulator than the one that was dealing with this operator in the period leading up to the 21 November 2015 crash.

The CAA has already commenced implementation of the Commissionâ€™s recommendation. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed to undertake the independent review, which will sample 200 inspection activities conducted over the period 1 January 2014 to 1 December 2018. At the time of writing, the PwC review was well advanced but was not yet complete. The work done to date has not identified any operators with significant non-compliances that have either not been identified or not been resolved. The independent review is expected to be completed by 31 March 2019 and the report will be made available to the Commission as soon as it is available.",

As TAIC will be aware, the Harbour Master is an appointee of the regional council, who is under a duty to ensure the maritime safety of ports in that region. The Harbour Master regularly makes extensive enquiries of the Port and is provided with the Port Engineer's sixmonthly assessment of berths. The Harbour Master issues Directions from time to time which, for example, determine the operating requirements and limitations that apply to vessels using the Port and to the Port itself.

Under these Directions, vessels must ask the Port for a berth at least 24 hours in advance. The Port must receive a declaration as to the particulars of the vessel. The Port will then determine if the Master holds the relevant Pilot Exemption Certificate (PEC) issued by Maritime New Zealand under Part 90 of the Maritime Rules. A PEC will not normally be issued for any vessel above 120m LOA.

Where a PEC is held, the vessel will be directed to a berth with prior approval for that vessel type from the Harbour Master under his powers contained in Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act 1994. Monthly meetings are conducted with the Harbourmaster and Maritime New Zealand. Infrastructure is a topic on the agenda. The Harbour Master will have regard to prior use of the berth and the port engineer's assessment in determining the grant of approval.

If a PEC is not held by the Master, then a Port Assessment will be jointly completed between the ship and the Port prior to arrival. Further pre-arrival information will also be passed onto the Master via the vessel's shipping agents.

The Port Assessment considers relevant factors such as wind conditions, the dimensions (LOA, draft) of the largest vessel to have called at the port, and the official restrictions of the Port and berths imposed by the Harbour Master and navigation safety bylaws.

Pilots work to a pilot procedure guide agreed by all the pilots, applying the Harbour Master's Directions and navigation safety bylaws. The guide details matters relevant to assessing risks such as standard mooring guides for use at Timaru, high wind procedures for each wharf and operating criteria in different environmental conditions. Pilots must receive from Masters a 'Pilot Information Card' as set out in the pilots' pre-movement checklist. Pilots work with Masters using the mooring guide and passage plan to determine safe piloting of the vessel to an appropriate berth, with Masters having the final say as to the manner in which the vessel is made and declared fast.

The Port will also respond to specific requests for information or audits from vessel operators such as Coastal Oil Logistics Ltd or cruise liners, using forms such as the Marine Terminal Criteria & Assessment Questionnaire. Audits cover matters such as jetty or berth structure, and the systems and operations used.",

The circumstances of this accident raise the question of whether the current training requirements for authorised technicians are adequate for a pressure vessel stored in a harsh marine environment.

On 22 November 2018 ","The accident highlighted the need to pay extra attention to all pressured gas cylinders/bottles that, exposed to harsh marine environment (and, sometimes, installed in difficult to reach positions) could experience localized corrosion not easily detected. Therefore, being the safety of human life at sea the core itself of our activity, we already took immediate actions in two ways:

1. We issued a circular letter to ALL involved shipowners in our data base recommending the immediate and thorough inspection of all cylinders on board their fleets and proposing unconditional replacement of all cylinders older than ten years (in respect to manufacturing date);

2. We released an internal bulletin providing to our technical personnel specific instructions on how to improve the level of examination on nitrogen cylinders and, in particular, on how to recognize heavy signs of corrosion and other evident damage.

It must be also stressed that the accident acutely made evident that a vacuum in the actual marine norms and regulations does exist. It is our firm conviction that a coordinate action by Flags administrations, international marine regulation bodies, naval registers as well as shipowners associations will be necessary to fill the current vacuum in order to avoid too much personal interpretation in this delicate; if not feasible to quickly develop specific marine rules, ashore heavy industry standards could be used as a pattern.",

On 23 May 2018 ","Way To Go confirms that it will implement the final recommendation contained in your letter of 25 May 2018. Way To Go expects the recommendation will be fully implemented by 30 September 2018.

By way of general comment, Way to Go has been progressing towards the implementation of Safety Management Systems and is focussing on risks that impact on safety. In addition, a â€˜Just Cultureâ€™ environment has been introduced and embraced by Way To Go over the past few years.

Weight and balance
Way To Go maintains that its weight and balance system was understood and used by pilots on an operational basis. However, Way To Go was working on and has introduced a modification to Aerial Toolbox to include a weight and balance calculation on each daily flight record that is a visual reminder of the operating limitations of the aircraft being flown. This tool is currently in its testing stage and should be ready for full functional use by 30 September 2018.

Incidents and accidents
Way To Go has recently updated the Aircare qualification. This has resulted in modifications and additions to the Quality Assurance system including a Reported Quality Improvement register, clear goals for Internal Audit processes, and requirements for documentation of responsibilities and follow ups from staff and executive meetings. 
These changes reflect formally documenting the processes Way To Go has always followed.

These changes will be internally audited for effectiveness in the quarter ending 30 September 2018.

Operating limits
Way To Go relies on the annual Flight Competency Check and the six monthly Competency Check for recording Pilot Training of operational limitations of aircraft. Way To Go has always documented these but has now also made recording compulsory of informal Pilot Toolbox and Crew Meetings which will help ensure records can prove Crew 
Training understanding.
The company is in a change period for Crew Training Manager and is reviewing a Procedural Update for Crew Training along with Risk Assessment documentation. Way To Go is also currently evaluating other procedural changes required to ensure personnel that are trained and competent in safety responsibilities are documenting such fully.

Reporting to TAIC
Way To Go will write again setting out the date when the recommendation was fully implemented, a brief description of how it was implemented and evidence to support its implementation.",

Subantarctic (and Kermadec) Islands, albeit that the appointment will not be made pursuant to the Maritime Transport Act 1994.

The Department intends to take the following actions in the first instance:
a. Obtain advice from Maritime New Zealand as to what qualifications and experience are necessary for a â€œsuitably qualified personâ€ to deliver harbourmaster functions for the Subantarctic (and Kermadec) Islands. Advice will also be sought on which harbourmaster functions are relevant to the Subantarctic (and Kermedec) Islands.
b. Request the same advice from Environment Canterbury Harbourmaster, an experienced harbourmaster, has provided the Department with expert maritime advice in the development of the regional coastal plan and during the appeal process. He is also personally familiar with both groups of islands.

Random testing is more useful than post-incident testing, as it is designed to act as a deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents instead of finding out after the event. The more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.

Comparative rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios, with some achieving a 50% testing programme within a 12-month period.

The Commission has recommended that Maritime New Zealand issue guidance and advice to operators and surveyors regarding the need to take a risk-based approach when determining the level of surveyor oversight required for changes to critical systems, regardless of whether those changes are considered major modifications.

I agree that maritime operators taking a risk-based approach to surveyor oversight of changes to critical systems is a sound approach. I also agree that a similar approach is appropriate for the work of surveyors.

I am advised that, because of the way that Maritime Rules Parts 44 and 19 are constructed, the issuance of such guidance may not achieve the intended effect. That is because they do not define 'critical systems' and they only require surveyor oversight and approval in the event of a major repair or a major modification.

It is my view that the more enduring way of achieving the objective identified by the Commission is to review the legal framework to support a risk-based approach to surveyor oversight. This would require amendments to Rule Parts 19 and 44; in particular, the addition of a definition of 'critical systems' and clarity as to the point at which surveyor oversight is required in the process of critical system changes.

Maritime New Zealand currently has a programme of work on its current regulatory programme which is well suited to consider this matter at some depth and may result in a proposal to change the rules, subject to Ministerial agreement. As the Commission may appreciate, if changes to the rules are required, this process could take a couple of years to complete.",

The Transport Agency believes that the enduring requirement of fire risk identification and mitigation and assurance is important. We do however note that the priority of rail risks may change over time and it considers that it is essential that the scope and focus of assessments adapts to the current risks and environment identified through the Transport Agency's risk based approach. For that reason it may prove difficult to eventually close these recommendations because of their on-going nature. However, when the Transport Agency has carried out the initial work in respect of all rail operators, we will engage with the Commission to discuss our perspective on how we can continue to gain assurance of the safety outcomes in question.",

148,2013_010,009/17,the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation ensure that helicopter operators who conduct snow landings address in their safety management systems the hazard of passenger disembarkation and embarkation during those landings while the rotors are turning.,"A safety issue identified during the inquiry was the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to helicopters parked on snow while the rotors are turning. Frequently the pilot will also disembark to guide the passengers while they move under the main rotor disc. There is a serious risk to people on the ground if a helicopter has settled into fresh snow or it breaks through an apparently hard surface crust. Should this happen the clearance between the rotor disc and people walking beneath could reduce sufficiently for someone to be struck by the rotor blades.

197,2014_103,005/15,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency require a full review of the National Rail System standards, and in particular standard No. 6, to ensure that low adhesion braking requirements are defined in the standards and made applicable for all trains intended to operate on the National Rail System.","Rail Standards for New Trains

The National Rail System Standards (6) (Engineering and Interoperability) is the only standard within the National Rail System set that defines braking performance. However, it does not address the performance in low adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer controlled brake and wheel slide protection systems. The current National Rail System Standard (6) does not require any more from a braking system than for a train to be able to stop within a specified distance in dry conditions.

The regulator for the country of operation or the purchaser may define what adhesion conditions might be encountered on a rail network and what level of braking performance is expected from a new train and what standards the train is to be tested to for compliance. This is also the stage in commissioning a new train, when the interaction between all of the brake systems is adjusted to achieve the optimum overall brake performance.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board in UK have produced a Guidance Note (GM/GN2695) to achieve this purpose in the UK but nothing similar exists for New Zealand.

The Matangi train brake systems were tested for compliance and proper operation, but they were not tested and adjusted for optimum brake performance in low adhesion conditions.

In Wellington, where new trains were commissioned into service with computer controlled braking and wheel slide protection systems, but that the complete train braking systems were not optimised to achieve the most effective brake performance in low adhesion conditions.  The Commission considers that the occurrences in Wellington may be repeated unless the National Rail System standards are revised. 

As a minimum the Commission considers that the National Rail System standards should call upon appropriate international standards to formalise new train type testing and ensure that train braking systems are tested in low adhesion conditions and optimised for the train.

The Commission is aware that new passenger trains have recently been introduced in Auckland.  The Commission is not aware of any safety issues with the new trains but expects they would have been tested to comply with the same National Rail System standards as the Matangi trains in Wellington. Therefore, they may be exposed to the same lack of optimised brake performance risks in low adhesion conditions.

","KiwiRail's current safety system deals with the issue of train driver advice through prescribing by rule the occasions Train Control must advise train drivers about any changes to routes. The absence otherwise of a rule means advice is not intended to be provided.

Advice to train drivers about a signalled route ahead is only intended to be given when there is a clear operational need (often not directly related to the signal itself) - such as a change in platform requiring a guard to operate different doors, or a locomotive engineer [train driver] crew change.

KiwiRail's safety system only prescribes mandatory circumstances when Locomotive Engineers need to be advised of a change in signal.

On 29 October 2014 ","KiwiRail have considered the recommendation and respond as follows:

-The KiwiRail risk matrix, which forms part of KiwiRail's risk management policy, applies across all business units and is designed to provide guidance when assessing many different types of risk for the business.
- The risk matrix provides a consistent methodology that can be applied across different business units and types of risks.
- When assessing a risk, the person or project team responsible must consider the context of the risk; the various consequences that may arise should a risk materialise, and the impacts of those consequences. As there may be multiple potential consequences, the consequence with the highest degree of impact should be used as the factor when determining the overall risk rating. Failure to do this may underestimate the level of risk exposure.
- The Commission have identified that although the initial project team used the risk matrix in order to determine the risk rating, the risk was evaluated based on the impact of continuity of core services being compromised as opposed to potential safety impacts.
- Rating the risk based only on the impact of continuity of core services resulted in the risk not receiving the required level of management attention. Had the risk been evaluated on the basis of potential adverse safety impacts, the risk would have been rated higher and therefore received the required degree of management attention.
- It is KiwiRail's view that the risk matrix did not contribute to the failure to identify train control as a business critical risk. Rather, the consequences of the risk were not adequately identified resulting in the risk not being assessed against potential safety consequences on the matrix. This resulted in a risk rating lower than it should have been.
- A Risk Management Manual was developed in July 2013 to provide guidance to KiwiRail business units in their assessment of risks and the application of the risk matrix. The Risk Management Manual highlights the need to assess all potential consequences and that the highest degree of impact should be used as the factor when determining the overall risk rating. The manual had not been released at the time this incident occurred. It is available to all staff on the KiwiRail intranet and risk assessment practices have improved significantly since this incident occurred.",

The life jacket is to be stowed in a readily accessible position. The Commission has previously recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that on all flights, if at any point a ditching is likely to have a better outcome than a forced landing on unfavourable terrain, life jackets should be carried. Helicopters descend at a much higher rate in autorotation than an aeroplane does when gliding. Therefore, even if life jackets are carried, helicopter passengers are likely to be faced with minimal time to find and fit their life jackets if faced with a ditching.

In this respect, it is noteworthy that the focus of the Commission's investigation primarily related to events in late 2011 and early 2013. Since that time the CAA has undergone considerable organizational change: a real focus of which has been to supplement its strong aviation technical expertise with an enhanced regulatory skill set. To this end it has recently invested considerable time and effort in articulating and strengthening its regulatory approach. This work started to take effect at about the same time as the Pauanui Beach runway overrun occurred and has subsequently both gained impetus and been consolidated. Examples of this investment include:

- significant changes to the CAAâ€™s existing Surveillance Policy made in Sep 2011. Relevant to the second element of the Commission Recommendation, the following direction was introduced regarding the raising of findings: ""When a document holder's performance falls below the required standard a finding will be raised"";
- new 'CAA Use of Regulatory Tools' policy introduced on 23 Sep 2011. The new policy was created to provide guidance to CAA staff about the use of regulatory tools in discharging their obligations;
- new 'Regulatory Operating Model' adopted and promulgated by the CAA on 17 Feb 2012. The new policy was created to sit above the 'CAA Use of Regulatory Tools"" policy and identify, at a high level, the overarching regulatory principles and approach the CAA adopts in discharging its obligations;
- [A consultant] has been engaged to up skill regulatory staff on good regulatory practice and operational risk management (workshops held May 2013 and Feb 2014). All senior regulatory staff, and the majority of all regulatory staff, have attended one of these seminars;
- the addition of Operational Risk Management and Safety Management System skills to the competency framework for regulatory staff. Development and the delivery of such training with the latest element of the training delivery commencing March 2012;
- internal review processes for regulatory functions ensure compliance with proper process and identify learnings that can drive improvement;
- review of the current risk profile 'triggers' for targeting oversight of any operator with action underway to move toward targeting of the upper quartile of the risk profile distribution (as opposed to utilizing fixed trigger 'scores' for this purpose); and
- the introduction of a risk-based approach to regulation that focusses attention on the circumstances of a particular case, the risks posed and the selection of the most appropriate regulatory intervention to provide the required risk mitigation.

The efforts outlined above constitute a significant strengthening and sharpening of the CAA's regulatory focus in the time since the overrun at Pauanui. While incremental improvement is always possible the CAA has invested considerably in providing its staff with the direction, guidance, skills and tools necessary for them to make sound, evidence-based decisions in the public interest.",

I also note that the inquiry's findings conclude that the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot, but include the possibility that the pilot may not have been impaired. Before I respond to the recommendation I would like to take this opportunity to comment on relevant work in the transport sector.

Drug and alcohol impairment in the aviation, maritime and rail sectors

Alcohol and drug impairment in the transport sector is an issue that the Ministry takes very seriously. Impairment in driving is one of the largest causes of serious road crashes in New Zealand, contributing to about a third of all road deaths every year.

The impact of drug and alcohol impairment on the aviation, rail and maritime sectors has been an area of focus for the Ministry. Following the review of safety practices within the adventure and outdoors commercial sectors conducted by the previous Department of Labour, in August 2012 the Government agreed to amendments to aviation and maritime rules to improve safety in these sectors. These amendments are now in force and include a requirement for adventure activity operators to include a description of how they will manage the safety risks associated with drug or alcohol impairment in their relevant safety plans (Organisational Management Systems for aviation and Safe Operational Plans for maritime).

To assist maritime operators, Maritime New Zealand has produced safety guidelines for managing risks related to alcohol and other drugs for raft and jet boat operators. The Maritime Transport Amendment Bill 2013, which has had its third reading and will come into force in the next few weeks, will implement the internationally applicable alcohol limit for merchant seafarers established by the 2010 amendments to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1995 (STCW).

The Civil Aviation Authority has worked closely with adventure aviation operators to support the development and implementation of drug and alcohol management policies that include testing. A detailed advisory circular for adventure aviation operators outlines the expectations for drug and alcohol monitoring and management, and what acceptable policies should include.

Many transport operators, particularly those involved in transporting members of the public, already have drug and alcohol management policies in place in the workplace. Operators regard this as good business practice and meeting the duties of employers and employees set out in the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992. Some operators that are involved in safety sensitive activities, such as Air New Zealand, Qantas, KiwiRail and Maersk Line have also introduced drug and alcohol policies involving testing regimes.

Statistics from the New Zealand Drug Detection Agency show that the number of workplace drug tests carried out in New Zealand increased 31 percent between 2011 and 2012, with an increase in alcohol tests of 32 percent over the same period. These results suggest that employers in safety sensitive areas, including transport, are taking workplace safety very seriously.

Drug testing on the road

The drug driving regime has been in force for just under four years. The Ministry has a project on its work programme to investigate developments in drug screening and testing technologies (and associated issues) that have occurred over this time. This work is due to take place during 2014.

Post accident testing

Aviation, maritime, and rail legislation does not currently provide for transport agencies, the Commission, or Police (except in relation to the STCW alcohol regime for international or large domestic vessels) to conduct toxicological tests following an accident. Only when a fatality occurs can a Coroner test for the presence and level of drugs and alcohol in the deceased as part of the post mortem investigation.

As a result there is a lack of New Zealand data to quantify the extent of alcohol and drug use in the aviation, maritime, and rail sectors, and its links to accidents and incidents. In comparison, the road sector's drug and random alcohol testing regime provides the necessary data to develop an understanding of the links between drug and alcohol use and accidents and incidents.

Compulsory post accident testing would provide valuable data on alcohol and drug use within the aviation, maritime and rail sectors in New Zealand. Aggregated data from the test results would inform future policy options, including the potential introduction of maximum limits and testing requirements, as noted in the Commission's recommendation.

In order to establish whether there is a case for a compulsory post accident drug and alcohol testing regime, the Ministry has commissioned the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) to investigate and report on:
- criteria to determine which accidents (and incidents) should be covered
- who should be tested
- the agency responsible for undertaking the testing
- the testing procedures to be used (with reference to current national and international standards) in order to safeguard the integrity and accuracy of the testing
- an offences and penalties regime for refusing to be tested or interfering with test results or samples
- the agency responsible for the data collection
- the cost of implementing a compulsory regime
- the legislative changes required to give effect to a compulsory regime.

Once we have the NZIER report, we will brief the Minister of Transport on the options. We expect to be able to do this in December 2013. The Minister may then need to take a paper to Cabinet regarding any further work.

Response to recommendation

This brings me to the Ministry response to your recommendation that the Ministry completes the work necessary to support the introduction of legislation or rules that will:
1. Prescribe allowable maximum levels for alcohol;
2. Prohibit persons from operating an aircraft, vessel or rail vehicle if they are impaired by drugs;
3. Require operators to implement drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regimes, including random testing; and
4. Prescribe post occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol.

The completion of the first three parts of the recommendation is dependent on the fourth, prescribing post occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol. As I have discussed earlier in this letter, the Ministry of Transport is already undertaking work, as a matter of priority, to determine the case for a compulsory post accident testing regime.

We will be able to confirm the next steps for post accident testing once the Minister has considered our advice. Of course we will keep the Commission informed of the progress of the post accident testing proposal, as well as any other work that relates to the Commissionâ€™s recommendation.

Finally, like the Commission, the Ministry also believes there should be zero tolerance of operator impairment where members of the public are being transported by sea, rail and air. We feel very deeply for the families of those who lost their lives in this accident.",

On 13 August 2013 ","As a consequence of the derailment and our internal investigation the following actions have already been completed by the Wellington EMU [electric multiple unit] depot management:
1. Manufacturers' inspection, repair and maintenance instructions are documented and followed
Engineers audited the Ganz Mavag manufacturers' documentation on Friday 16 August to establish what information and/or references are required in documentation and work instructions
2. Safety critical components are identified and documented
Staff notice #24 has been issued to detail the safety critical jobs and the information is also in poster form around the depot.
3. Work instructions are issued for maintaining all equipment
Based on the audit of the Ganz manufacturers' documentation, work instructions for the Ganz fleet are being developed starting with the safety critical tasks. There are not currently work instructions for repairs.
4. Work on safety-critical components is signed off by someone other than the maintainer
Safety-critical tasks are now identified and individually checked and signed off by an appropriately qualified staff member who has not completed the job. Requirement for a counter-sign has been added to the work sheets.
5. All maintenance is recorded
SAP is used to record all maintenance and that data was supplied to TAIC [the Transport Accident Investigation Commission] during the investigation.

The TAIC preliminary report has also made a much more general recommendation that Maintenance is undertaken in accordance with good railway engineering practice. This is already the case as much as can be practicably expected within the profile of the railway fleet. It is unclear to us at this stage that it would be practical to, for example create detailed work instructions for locomotives that are in some cases several decades old. In some cases the assets will end their operational life before such a task could be completed. However, we will put in place a review of this and where it is practical to put this in place â€“ we will. Where it is not we will instead put in place the best practical mitigation.",

It is an indication that New Zealand port and harbour authorities cannot totally rely on the International Safety Management system to ensure that vessels transiting New Zealand ports are operated safely and efficiently. Minor technical defects and human performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on board a vessel.

The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and harbour authorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel defects and crew performance issues. The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately available to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage operations at subsequent ports. The purpose of the system should not be to replace the mandatory reporting of accidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.","The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and harbour authorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel defects and crew performance issues.

","Maritime New Zealand has previously commented on the distribution of incident and accident notifications, and also on the monthly summaries, which are now posted on the Maritime New Zealand public website.

Martime New Zealand understands that this is what already happens routinely and considers there is no need to formalise it. Maritime New Zealand's previous comment on this recommendations is set out below, and is reiterated in light of the above recommendation:

MNZ has online report system in place - this facilitates the notification of information including vessel defects and crew performance issues. The recent shift to a regional structure and the development of an intelligence and planning team has resulted in a more timely response to any information received. Furthermore, notifications received by MNZ are forwarded to the appropriate harbourmaster for their information as well as a monthly summary of all notifications. It is intended that these monthly summaries will in future be posted on MNZ's website making them more readily availably to Pilots, [this is now the case] Harbourmasters, Port Companies and any oter interested parties.

240,2011_004,018/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he take action, in concert with the aviation industry, to improve the level of compliance with Civil Aviation Rules and conformance with industry best practice throughout the general aviation maintenance sector.","The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that general aviation maintenance practices in New Zealand are not always in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules or accepted industry practice. The findings show that non-compliance occurs in certificated maintenance organisations and by individual maintenance engineers exercising their individual licence privileges. This is an indication that the safety issue is not specific to just one sector of aviation maintenance. If left unchecked this situation is likely to have significant implications for aviation safety.

On 25 July 2013 "
241,2011_004,019/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he widen the range of aircraft systems that require duplicate checks after specified maintenance, at least for those aircraft used in air transport operations, in order to reduce the likelihood of recurring defects and incidents.","The requirement for duplicate inspections after maintenance is performed on critical aircraft systems reduces the risk of a maintenance error remaining undetected and causing an accident. However, there are only a few specified control systems that are deemed critical and that require duplicate inspections. There are other important systems â€“ for example, the landing gear and brakes â€“ that are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. This is a safety issue, particularly for aircraft used in air transport operations where the consequences of an accident could be greater.

The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that because duplicate inspections are currently confined to critical control systems only, the risk of undetected maintenance errors in important, but non-critical, aircraft systems is not sufficiently mitigated. This accident was a prime example of how maintenance errors that are made in an important system and that are not detected then or during subsequent maintenance can become causal factors in an accident. The risks were higher in this case because the relevant maintenance events had been performed by independent engineers on parts of an aeroplane sub-system that were not subject to duplicate inspections.

On 25 July 2013 "
242,2010_204,004/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and harbour authorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel defects and crew performance issues. The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately available to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage operations at subsequent ports. The purpose of the system should not be to replace the mandatory reporting of accidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.","The number of defects that are causing incidents and accidents in New Zealand pilotage waters is of concern. It is an indication that New Zealand port and harbour authorities cannot totally rely on the International Safety Management system to ensure that vessels transiting New Zealand ports are operated safely and efficiently. Minor technical defects and human performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on board a vessel. If the issues of mechanically unreliable vessels and substandard crew resource management on vessels operating into New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues as they arise.

"
243,2011_103,007/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System Standard Executive in developing a National Rail System Standard that requires all rail participants to have drug and alcohol policies that: have zero tolerance of performance-impairing substances for workers engaged in safety-critical tasks; require post-incident and accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol; and require a system for rail workers to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace.,"The protection person was a user of cannabis. Although it could not be established scientifically that his performance was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident, he did have a detectable level of THC-acid in his urine when he was tested after the incident.
Under no circumstances should the performance of any rail worker performing any safety-critical task be affected by alcohol or drugs of any kind. "
244,2010_204,005/13,"The Commission recommends that, once the Marine Legislation Bill has been enacted and the new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force, the Director address this safety issue with all port authorities, including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management Systems.","Vessels' machinery installations and their control systems are complex, and regardless of how well maintained they are there will always remain the possibility that some part fails for some reason. For a vessel like the Hanjin Bombay that has only one propulsion system, the risk of losing control of the vessel caused by a single-point failure is higher than that for other vessels that have greater levels of redundancy built in to their propulsion and power-management systems. These types of vessel rely heavily on tug services when operating in confined pilotage waters.
Port of Tauranga Limited's Port and Harbour Safety system policy on the level of tug service did not adequately manage the risk of single-point failures leading to the loss of control of a vessel. This is a safety issue that could also be relevant to other New Zealand ports.
The Maritime Transport Act 1994 currently restricts the Director's powers to audit port operators. However, the Commission notes that the Marine Legislation Bill currently before Parliament will introduce a new Part 3A to the Maritime Transport Act, which will provide clear authority for the Director to take action in relation to port operations.
"
245,2011_103,006/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take the necessary steps to ensure that KiwiRail's safety system maintains accurate and up-to-date training and revalidation records of all staff competencies. The action taken should also check that KiwiRail's safety system ensures that all staff are qualified and competent for their roles.,"At the time of this incident KiwiRailâ€™s safety system could not ensure that infrastructure staff were competent to perform their roles, and could not ensure that the appropriate safety observations and revalidations of current staff competency had been undertaken.
"
246,2012_201,002/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand clarifies with industry the legal requirements around dual purpose use of vessels and the use of commercial vessels as pleasure craft, and ensures that safe ship management documents refer to the full requirements an owner must comply with before the vessel is used for another purpose.",
247,2012_201,003/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand addresses these 2 safety issues in any educational campaigns by making it clear that not all life jackets that can be purchased in New Zealand are approved and meet the requirements of New Zealand Maritime Rules, and that persons who have a large physique should purchase or be provided with a life jacket that is appropriate for their physique.","A number of the passengers and crew on the Easy Rider had a large physique. There were only 3 adult and one child lifejackets on board to share among 9 passengers and crew. The 3 adult lifejackets were not large enough to be securely fitted to those passengers and crew whom had a large physique. The Maritime Rules make provision for the carriage of childrenâ€™s lifejackets but are silent on the need for larger lifejackets to cater for people whom have a large physique. This is a safety issue.
Larger oversize approved life jackets are available in New Zealand, and at least one manufacturer will custom make a life jacket to suit.
Maritime Rules require that an approved life jacket be carried for every person on board every recreational and commercial vessel. While an approved life jacket is marked as complying with the appropriate standard, other life jackets are freely available for purchase that are not approved to the appropriate standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some other standard that is not accepted in New Zealand. An unwary purchaser, particularly a recreational boating person, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a life jacket approved to New Zealand standards. This is another safety issue.
"
248,2012_201,001/13,"The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand develops and maintains a system for centralising important operating and safety records for every commercial vessel in the New Zealand maritime system, including a policy on the retention and disposal of records that would best ensure records are kept for an appropriate period after a vessel leaves the system.","Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient information about the Easy Rider, a vessel that was still actively in the system. Maritime New Zealand was not able to find the older part of the ship file. Consequently the Commission had to rely on records from other vessels in order to make a reasonable assessment of the Easy Rider's stability.
When the Easy Rider was converted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo a simplified stability assessment, which it did, but the records sourced from the safe ship management company included only partial details of the inclining test and stability calculation that had been carried out. There was no record of the stability advice letter said to have been sent to the owner. Such a letter would normally include recommendations on the loading of the vessel.
Because commercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel in the system.
"
249,2010_008,029/12,"The Commission recommends that the Director use the appropriate forums and publications to educate and remindinforms flight instructors at all levels of the findings of this report, and in particular that their first responsibility is the safety of the aircraft they are commanding before attending to the needs of their student pilot.  Further, andinstructors are reminded of their responsibility for ensuring a student pilot is informed and competent to listen for, see and avoid other aircraft before allowing them to fly solo.","The Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions both involved instructors who, because of their experience and training, should have been the most capable of the pilots to be able to recognise the potential for a mid-air collision and take avoiding action.

265,2012_201,020/12,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand trace the whereabouts of the remaining Owenga class fishing vessels and ensure that the appropriate stability calculations have been made for each vessel and alert the owners to any special stability characteristics they should be considering in the daily operation of their vessels.,"At about 2000 on 14 March 2012, the fishing vessel Easy Rider departed Bluff for Great South Cape Island off the west coast of Stewart Island.  The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Great South Island, where they were to prepare for the upcoming mutton-bird harvest.  The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.
>>>>>>> origin/main

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.  The vessel was constructed of steel and was about 11 metres overall length with a beam of about 3.55 metres.  It was powered by a single diesel engine.  There was thought to have been 9 of its class built.  Four (including the Easy Rider) have been lost at sea over the years for differing reasons including one that was overwhelmed by a large wave, and 5 are thought to be still in use.  One of these 5 is currently being used for commercial fishing out of Bluff.

The Commission is in the process of firstly modelling the Easy Riderâ€™s 'light ship' stability from data obtained for other vessels of the Owenga class, and secondly estimating its actual stability on the accident voyage.

The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made preliminary calculations that support this view.

Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessels were built and with successive changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.

I also urge the Commission to note the existing health and safety in employment regulatory regime, where drugs and alcohol are specifically mentioned in the definition of hazard. This regime already places obligations on both employers and employees.
Since the Fox Glacier accident the Minister of Transport has approved a new Rule Part 115 that entered into force in November 2011.  The Rule requires adventure aviation operations to be certified by 1 May 2012.  Adventure aviation organisations, including commercial parachuting, now face the risk that their safety certification can be suspended and removed for safety violations. This gives such operators a stronger incentive to ensure they address alcohol and drug taking safety risks in their organisations.
Over the next two years the Government will be considering rule amendments that would require aviation organisations to introduce safety management systems.  This would require certificated operators to assess and mitigate all safety risks relevant to their operation.  This risk of intoxication of personnel by drugs and alcohol would clearly be a safety risk that we would expect both operators and the Civil Aviation Authority (when certifying and auditing aviation organisations) to be actively addressing under an SMS regime.  Decisions will also be made in the near future to ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority is resourced to transition to the ICAO-endorsed SMS approach which has widespread industry support.
Whilst recognising that where the illegal use of drugs is involved, changing individual behaviour will be challenging, the Ministry will encourage the Civil Aviation Authority to step up its effort to alert the aviation community through education of the risks that drugs pose to the safety operation of aviation undertakings.  This will require an ongoing effort. 
As you are aware, the Ministry has developed a Transport Regulatory Policy Statement that specific rule changes may not always be the best interventions to achieve desire safety outcomes.  Non-regulatory interventions can often be more appropriate.  In this regard we appreciate the Commission's recommendation to promote a drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regime, rather than to implement a regime.
The Ministry of Transport has in the past sponsored an inter-agency Substance Impairment Group.  This looked at whether or not compulsory random drug and alcohol testing, and specific breath alcohol limits, should be required by regulation in the aviation, marine and rail transports modes.  In part because of a lack of data, we were not convinced at that time that the costs would outweigh the benefits.  We will, however, monitor international experience in this regard and, in particular, the recent relevant changes in the Australian aviation regime.",

","Following this collision incident, staff from the NZ Transport Agency, MWH (infrastructure consultants), KiwiRail and Kapiti Coast District Council met and implemented the following actions:

The NZ Transport Agency has erected a surveillance camera on-site and is currently monitoring the usage of this crossing by heavy vehicles, driver behaviour and the number of incidents caused by road profiling and/or stacking distances;

The design and profiling of the level crossing have been assessed. As a result, remedial work covering re-profiling the intersection and redesign of the splitter island to create room for a large vehicle to make a left turn in the situation when a right turn is not possible is underway. Works are expected to be completed by 16 May 2012 as part of a programmed carriageway rehabilitation scheme.

Aspects of the bus design have also been considered.

The Land Transport Rule: Vehicle Dimensions and Mass (the Rule) in table 4.1 specifically sets ground clearance requirements for all heavy vehicles based on a design to adequately clear level rail crossings and similar. The required clearance is the greater of 100 millimetres or 6% of the distance from the nearest axle to the point where the ground clearance is measured. The actual ground clearance of the bus does comply. It is noted that the bus has a manual override to lower the bus to facilitate ease of boarding by lowering passenger floor height. This feature is permitted under Rule when the vehicle is loading or unloading.

The NZ Transport Agency has also noted that a circular produced by the Bus and Coach Association has been distributed following this collision. It highlights this incident and particularly the Train Control emergency contact number.

","KiwiRail has provided information that there are now 252 level crossings with less than 23 metres distance between the centreline of the nearest railway line and the continuity/edge line at an adjacent intersection where road traffic from the railway does not have right of way. I have attached a register for your information. The register of crossings has been coded according to collision history in the last ten years. There are nine crossings that had two or more collisions. Of these five had alarm upgrades during this period and there have been no further collisions.

Further analysis by KiwiRail indicates that average collision rates (adjusted for the level of both road and rail traffic) at crossings where there are adjacent intersections within 23 metres are only 6% higher than collision rates at crossings with no nearby intersection. This suggests that it is where there is a high level of traffic on the parallel road that risk of collision significantly increases.

","The stacking distance issue applying to right turning traffic exiting/entering Beach Road from State Highway One [one] is acknowledged. However a solution to this is problematic.

Restriction of turning movements out of Beach Road is not favoured by the Kapiti Coast District Council. However, the prohibition of right turns out of Hill Road would simplify movements at the intersection and might aid right turns out of Beach Road. This option will be investigated further.

Installation of traffic signals is a high cost option requiring land acquisition. Although this is favoured by the Kapiti Road District Council, it has the potential to impose significant delays on the State Highway resulting in queuing and the potential to increase the collision risk. The current crash record at the intersection is low and it is likely that this option would increase it.

The AD was sent immediately to all operators of Fletcher series aircraft conducting parachute operations.  We accept that this is based on information gained early in the investigation and the issue of the AD should be considered to be immediate interim action pending completion of your investigation.
AD DCA/FU24/179 Parachuting Operations â€“ Limitation and C of C Determination requires;
1.	Amendment of the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) to restrict maximum occupancy of the cabin aft of F.S 118.84 to six persons.  This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of the AD into the AFM adjacent to the applicable supplement for parachuting operations.
2.	No parachuting operation is to be conducted with any number of occupants, unless for each individual flight:
a.	A weight and balance calculation is performed to establish that the aircraft Centre of Gravity will remain within AFM limits for the duration of the flight, and
b.	The calculation uses actual weights for all occupants and their equipment, and
c.	The calculation accounts for the positions of all occupants.  The occupantsâ€™ positions shall be taken as the most aft positions that result from the rearmost members of the group sitting against the aft cabin wall and subsequent occupants located immediately forward of them, unless a means of restraint is provided to prevent the occupants moving rearwards from their normal position, and 
d.	A record of the Centre of Gravity determination is kept for each parachuting operation.
The effective date of the AD is 11 September 2010 and compliance with 1 and 2 above is required before further parachute-drop operations and before every parachute-drop operation, respectively.",

In doing so, CAA will review all AFM parachute operation supplements, including those approved by delegation holders or foreign authorities to ensure that they provide adequate determination of the Centre of Gravity position.
In addition to the ADs, CAA has commenced a broader safety review of parachuting operations, to establish if there are other safety issues arising.  The review includes existing parachuting flight manual supplements, pilot training and type ratings for FU24 series aircraft, the provision of operational information to pilots, clarification of aircraft loading limitations and a review of the necessity of seating and/or restraint systems for parachutists.",

As Director, I cannot mandate specific actions for individual aerodromes on the issue at the core of the recommendation. However, the Aeronautical Information  Publication Bulletin Volume 1 AD 1.5 clearly provides advice on the issue of Standard
Overhead Circuit Joining procedures.
Consequently, I do not accept the recommendation as written.
I will undertake to make aerodrome operators aware of the TAIC recommendation, and their responsibilities with respect to the formation of aerodrome user groups/safety committees.
I will also undertake to make aerodrome operators aware of the risks associated with a 'mix' of operational activities, and their need to develop appropriate local procedures to minimise the risk of mid-air collisions.

Within the resources available to it, the CAA directs its attention to those aerodromes were risk is assessed as being highest - in this case to certificated aerodromes and non-certificated aerodromes engaged in regular passenger transport operations using 19-seat or more aircraft.
The CAA does not have the resources available to it to monitor all aerodromes 'equally'. However, CAA staff (e.g., aviation safety advisers, etc), actively engage with aerodrome users and others to identify risks and associated mitigations.
Consequently, I accept the recommendation in principle, with the caveat that the
CAAâ€™s actions and engagement are driven by:
- Assessment of risk; and
- Targeting resources to areas of highest risk.

303,2008_109,044/10,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive require KiwiRail Network to review the Fruitvale Road Station and associated arrangements for protecting the adjacent level crossing, to see if speed restrictions or other changes to the signalling system can be made to minimise the possibility of an overrunning train entering an unprotected level crossing, without compromising the waiting time for motorists using the level crossing. This review should be extended to other stations where the distance between the stations and level crossings is less than the recommended 150 metres.","The location of the Fruitvale Road level crossing close to the Fruitvale Road Station platform represents a risk to level-crossing users in the event of a platform overrun for whatever the reason. There is a delicate balance between the signalling ensuring the level crossing is protected in the event of a platform overrun and ensuring road users are not kept waiting for so long as to engender the known unsafe practice of road users ignoring signals and barriers and entering the level crossing ahead of passing trains.
Speed restrictions are often used around the rail network as a method of supplementing signals to ensure trains can stop within the available distance ahead without passing signals at danger.

This recommendation has been sent to the IACS for its information so that Class surveyors can check for this peculiarity when surveying this make of watertight door. (027/11)",
305,2009_202,025/11,"The issue of serious harm resulting from the operation of watertight doors remains a safety issue that has not been resolved by the maritime industry worldwide, and some advice to mariners in its various forms, including that given by the International Maritime Organisation, could unintentionally exacerbate the issue.
The Commission therefore recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand forwards this report to the IMO, draws its attention to the issues discussed around rules, regulations and advice given to mariners for the operation of watertight doors, and invites the IMO to revisit the issue through other mechanisms that will address the human element, through watertight door design for example. (025/11)",
306,2009_201,002/11,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand and the Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand address these 2 safety issues through the appropriate forum with local government organisations with a view to achieving an appropriate level of safety and consistency in safety standards on affected inland waterways.,"When a speed uplifting is granted by local government organisations or by Maritime New Zealand, this is effectively a reversal of measures taken to mitigate a previously identified risk of accidents occurring between craft travelling at high speed and other recreational water activities.
In the case of the Kawarau River, it is a safety issue that few additional measures have been taken to mitigate the additional risks that the speed uplifting has created. This situation probably exists on the Kaituna River and therefore could also exist in other waterways where the speed restrictions have been uplifted.
A second safety issue is that there is an inconsistency between Maritime Rules Part 91 where speed upliftings applied for under Rule 91.21 require a risk assessment, and then if successful, public notification and notification in the Gazette, and speed upliftings enacted by navigation bylaws that are not subject to risk assessment, approval by the Director, and publication in the Gazette.
"
307,2009_201,005/11,"Until legislation is made setting limits for and testing of alcohol and other performance impairing substances for recreational and commercial boat drivers, the risk of alcohol-related accidents will be elevated.
It is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address this safety issue by promoting appropriate legislation to set maximum allowable levels of alcohol and other performance impairing substances for persons in charge of recreational and commercial craft, and supporting legislation to allow testing for such levels in these cases.",
308,2009_201,003/11,"The Commission recommends to the Secretary of Transport that he liaise with the Director of Maritime New Zealand to address this safety issue, either by a change to the Maritime Rules or through some other appropriate forum.","Maritime Rules Part 80 required commercial jet-boat drivers to undergo a minimum of 50 hours training before being licensed to drive commercial jet-boats, but the Rule did not require the drivers to hold formal Maritime Documents requiring them to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the collision-prevention rules (Maritime Rules Part 22) and other maritime skills required of drivers of other types of commercial craft.
While acknowledging that some jet-boat operations do not require interactions with other craft (the Shotover Jet is one example), most commercial jet-boats operate on rivers and lakes where they must coexist with recreational and other commercial craft.
"
309,2009_201,006/11,"Some commercial jet-boats on the Kawarau River have been travelling at unsafe speeds in contravention of Maritime Rules. A similar situation probably exists on the Kaituna River, and possibly on rivers in other areas as well.

310,2009_201,007/11,"Three of the 5 persons involved in this accident received serious head injuries and 2 of these died as an indirect result.
There are a number of other activities where the benefit of wearing a helmet has been recognised: cycling, snow skiing, motorcycling, white-water kayaking and white-water rafting to name a few. Given the protection they can provide, it would seem that wearing them on a personal watercraft would be wise and there may be a case for it to be mandatory.
Whether wearing a helmet in a jet-boat or any other craft capable of high-speed is practicable will require some research.
It is recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand work with the National Pleasure Boat Safety Forum and the New Zealand Jet Sports Boating Association on an educational campaign for the voluntary wearing of safety helmets on personal watercraft engaged in high risk water activities, with a goal of mandating their use.",
311,2009_201,004/11,"While persons in charge of recreational craft are not required to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of Maritime Rules around collision avoidance, the risk of collisions and other mishaps will be elevated, increasingly so with increases in recreational boating activity.
It is recommended that the Secretary for Transport address this safety issue by recommending rules or some other mechanism that require the person in charge of a designated recreational craft to hold a licence or certificate that requires them to be appropriately educated to identified standards.",
312,2009_101,043/10,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency give high priority to working with industry to conduct a formal assessment of the risks that main-line derailments pose to rolling stock and track infrastructure, and the risk of serious harm to people (industry and the general public). The results of the risk assessment should then be used to set appropriate remedial measures to reduce the likelihood of bogie side frame failures, and could also be used to set appropriate measures to reduce main-line derailments from other causes.","The most likely reason for the side frame failures is that they had reached the end of their fatigue lives. A lack of identifying marks and records of side frame age and maintenance history means that it will be difficult to predict the onset of fatigue cracking in bogie side frames. The presence of fatigue cracking initiating in the region of the radius, just beyond the wear plate of the side frames, is difficult to detect by normal visual inspections, and at the current rate of MPIs the entire inventory of bogie side frames will not be completed until 2020. With 60% of the side frames tested consistently requiring weld repairs before being returned to service, the failure and collapse of a bogie side frame have resulted, and will continue to result, in significant damage to rolling stock and track infrastructure and the risk of serious harm to people.
"
313,2009_103,039/10,"The Commission recommends that the New Zealand Transport Agency oversee a review of KiwiRailâ€™s severe weather warning system and underlying processes for effective communication of warnings to ensure that it results in an appropriate level of awareness, actions and responses to severe weather events across the entire rail system.","The present severe weather warning system described by Rail Operating Rules and Procedures Section 1, Rule 6(b) does not require feedback from area managers to the network control manager on receipt of severe weather alerts, which creates an open loop information flow and prevents the network control manager from maintaining an overview of severe weather actions being taken across the entire network. Network control managers spoken to did not see maintaining an overview of actions during severe weather as their responsibility. In this case the network control manager did not monitor the severe weather alerts as they were being updated by MetService, with the result that neither the area manager nor his staff nor the locomotive engineers of trains in that area were aware of the current severe weather alert. Current contact details for recipients of severe weather warnings from network control were also allowed to lapse.

It included a method for assessing potential groundwater conditions, slope stability, soil type, surface cover, slope alterations and rail traffic and outlined a framework to come up with a risk rating. The proposed rollout of this system was over the next 2 financial years but this had not been confirmed at the time of writing. Analysis of available data such as rainfall, river flows and slip activity can be a useful activity to complement the proposed risk-ranking system for determining slip hazard risk, but this data is not currently used by the rail industry. Until the risk-ranking system has been completed, the risk to the rail network from unpredicted slips is likely to be higher than is reasonably acceptable.
"
316,2009_103,041/10,The Commission recommends that the NZ Transport Agency oversee KiwiRail Networkâ€™s internal review of its track and structures inspection regimes defined in the codes T003 and W004 to ensure that the outcome is a combined track inspection process that covers all aspects of the track risk assessment using a methodology guided by that defined in NRSS 4: Risk Management.,"The existing track and structures inspection codes were prescriptive and did not embrace the risk assessment principles documented in the more recent Structures Inspection Manual W200 or required for rail systems under National Rail System Standard (NRSS) 4.

317,2010_009,037/10,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation as a matter of urgency alerts all pilots and operators using the Fletcher FU24-954 aircraft for parachuting operations that when loaded with 6 or more passengers it is possible for the aircraft CG to be aft of the allowable limit, and that this could result in control difficulties, and that parachutists should be seated in the forward cabin area, preferably restrained to prevent them inadvertently moving rearward.",
318,2010_009,038/10,The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation as a matter of urgency reviews the approvals granted for the FU24-954 aircraft with a view to amending the Flight Manual to allow more accurate determinations of aircraft centre of gravity.  This review should also extend to other conversions of Fletcher and Cresco aircraft.,

320,2008_205,029/10,"Several deaths of crew in the inshore and coastal fishing fleet, including the 2 seafarers lost in this accident, have been attributed, at least in part, to the absence of an effective anchor watch, in spite of the various marine notices and other literature on the topic of keeping anchor watches. A review of the Maritime New Zealand database together with data available from other nations and the International Maritime Organization would be useful in measuring the magnitude of the issue, and would serve as a useful tool to work with the fishing industry to resolve what has become a routine poor practice.",
321,2008_205,030/10,"Operators' safety management systems should indentify risks to their operations and put in place processes to mitigate any identified risk. The share fishing system of remuneration has the potential to place significant commercial pressure on skippers, which could compromise good judgment when making decisions affecting the safety of their vessels and crew. This potentially serious safety issue should be addressed through operators' safety management systems with guidance from Maritime New Zealand in consultation with fishing industry organizations.",
322,2007_105,035/10,"The National Rail System Standard has not been fully reviewed since they were established in 2004. Once the status of the standards and its Committee has been established then an independent review of the standards should be conducted to determine if they are still applicable to the New Zealand rail industry, and to ensure if they are representative of standards set in other comparative countries operating modern rail systems.",
323,2007_105,033/10,"It was recommended to the Secretary for Transport that he address the status of the National Rail System Standard and the relationship between these standards and rail participants' safety cases and underlying safety systems is not clear. For example, it is not clear whether KiwiRail's safety case and its underpinning safety system can be required to comply with the NRSS as a minimum, or whether the NRSS is subservient to KiwiRail's safety system. An approved (by the regulator) change to KiwiRail's safety system could then by default become an approved change to the NRSS. If the latter, then it is also unclear what the relationship between the NRSS and other rail participants' safety cases and underpinning safety systems would be.",
324,2007_105,031/10,"The push/pull train sets were signed off as fit for purpose and commissioned to the Auckland passenger train network when they did not comply with the National Rail System Standard with regard to maximum allowable stopping distance as a complete train, and it has not yet been proven that they do so under all conditions of loading and track condition.",
325,2007_105,034/10,"It was recommended to the Secretary for Transport that he address the following safety issues: The status of the NRSS Committee, the rights to membership of that committee and the responsibilities of each Committee member, and the terms of reference of the Committee is currently unclear.

326,2007_105,032/10,"The training system for drivers of the push/pull sets on the Auckland rail network did not use standard training techniques, did not teach standard best practice methods for train operations, and did not include appropriate standards for minder drivers to achieve before being certified to teach trainee drivers.",
327,2009_005,036/10,"Inquiries into this and previous incidents involving air traffic controllers have relied on radar and radiotelephone recordings, and the statements made by the air traffic controllers. However, verbal communications between controllers in the same work space is critical and integral element of the process for controlling aircraft but are currently not recorded. Without controller-station local area recordings, investigations will not always be able to identify all the contributing factors to an incident or accident and therefore valuable learnings might be lost.
The Commission believes this is a safety issue that the Director needs to address by initiating discussions with industry with a view to mandating the installation of air traffic controller station local-area recordings and providing the appropriate level of protection for such recordings as intended by ICAO for the purposes of assisting any future safety investigations.",
328,2008_206,028/10,"The Monte Stello was fitted with a voyage data recorder (VDR), but it had not been maintained in working order because New Zealand Maritime Rules do not require one to be fitted. Even New Zealand-registered ships to which SOLAS has been applied are currently not required to be fitted with a VDR because New Zealand Maritime Rules have not been updated to incorporate changes made to SOLAS that came into effect in July 2002. Even if SOLAS requirements for VDRs had been incorporated into New Zealand Maritime Rules, the Monte Stello would not have been required to have one fitted because it was not trading internationally. The Wellington/Picton Cook Strait ferry operation combines roll-on-roll-off ships operating in challenging enclosed water pilotage and a stretch of open water renowned for challenging sea conditions.
The contribution to improving maritime safety world-wide by requiring certain classes of ships to be fitted with VDRs has been recognized by the IMO for many years, particularly for roll-on-roll-off ships such as the Monte Stello and the other current Cook Strait ferries. Until New Zealand-registered ships of the type trading across Cook Strait are fitted with VDRs or equivalent means of recording data, New Zealand and the greater maritime community are losing the potential safety benefits these devices provide.
Changes should be made to relevant New Zealand legislation that will result in all Cook Strait roll-on/roll-off ferries being required to have a fully SOLAS compliant VDR, or where not practicable to fit such equipment, other means to record as many operating parameters as practicable. (028/10)",
329,2008_206,026/10,"During the Picton berthing occurrence the master was captive to the propeller pitch controls and could not totally oversee the second officer who was under training, nor could he totally monitor the progress of the ship as it backed into the berth. The Commission is of the opinion that Cook Strait ferry operators should identify in their training system for pilotage and ship-handling, masters or other appropriately qualified officers who have been selected and appropriately schooled as training masters, and while ship-handling or pilotage training is in progress, the bridge team should be resourced to allow the training master freedom to totally and effectively monitor the trainee and the progress of the ship. (026/10)",
330,2008_206,027/10,"The operator's system for planned maintenance and repair neither accurately record the history of inspection and repair, nor ensured the proper functioning of the controllable pitch propellers and their control systems, which were critical to the safe operation of the ship. The operator's planned maintenance and repair system should be comprehensively audited to ensure it meets the outcomes required by the ISM Code. (027/10)",
331,2009_005,021/10,"The Mercer PDA is near a busy international and domestic airport and close to the tracks flown by aircraft flying from Auckland to Tauranga, which alone elevates the risk of midair collisions if air traffic controllers lose awareness of aircraft operating in and around the PDA, or if aircraft deviate outside the PDA. The MOU between the Mercer Skydiving Centre and Airways allows for special communication procedures that mean an aircraft could be operating within the PDA for up to 15 minutes without communicating with air traffic controllers, which together with the poor definition of the PDA on controllersâ€™ screens could contribute to controllers losing situational awareness of aircraft operating in and around the PDA and increase the risk of the required separation of aircraft being breached.
The Commission believes these are safety issues that the Director needs to address with Airways and recommends that the Director work with Airways to review the management of the Mercer PDA, including a general risk assessment of the operation, and consider whether these safety issues extend to other PDAs and associated memoranda of understanding.",
332,2008_110,017/10,"Standards for maximum working hours and minimum rest periods on the train control roster could result in a train controller being fatigued at the start of a shift even in the absence of any other fatigue-inducing factors. The train control roster policy including, but not limited to, standards for maximum working hours and minimum rest periods should be reviewed to ensure it is designed to mitigate fatigue and promote wellness.",
333,2009_005,024/10,"The controllers were unaware of the activation of the STCA, which remained illuminated for about 30 seconds before the 2 aircraft crossed. The STCA is potentially a controllerâ€™s last defence for averting a collision and needs to be acknowledged in every case. The lack of response in this incident may indicate that either the STCA activation indications were not effective or controllers had become desensitised to the indications due to a high number of 'nuisance' alerts, or a combination of both.
The Commission believes this is a safety issue that the Director needs to address with Airways and recommends that Airways be required to review the operation of the STCA to ensure it is effective in reducing the risk of a collision and that controllers are sufficiently aware of the risk of ignoring what might be perceived as nuisance alerts.",
334,2009_005,022/10,"Air traffic control is a highly safety-critical function of the aviation system, yet the process by which Airways ensured that workplace practices were in accordance with documented procedures was not effective, as shown by the non-compliance with written and agreed roster requirements.
The Commission believes this is a safety issue that the Director needs to address with Airways and recommends that Airways be required to implement an effective and auditable means of capturing the performance of individual controllers in a systematic way, as will be expected under the principles of safety management systems.",
335,2008_110,018/10,"During this incident, 2 successive train control handovers were conducted in a fashion that did not detect the presence of all train movements, and on each occasion the trainee, then the incoming controller, assumed the responsibility for the desk before they had acquired full situational awareness of the status of all movements within their area. The area of train control would benefit from some form of external review of processes to identify if these practices were confined to this one event or symptomatic of a wider systemic issue.",
336,2009_005,025/10,"This incident highlighted a number of individual failures in the system for managing aircraft separation within the Auckland Terminal sector, the busiest sector within the New Zealand air traffic control system. Together with the findings of the NOSS, this indicates that a deeper systemic issue within the overall management of the sector may exist.
The Commission believes this is a safety issue that the Director needs to address with Airways and recommends that a review of Airways' operations be undertaken to confirm that the proposed re-organisation, including the centralisation of auditing and safety functions, will identify and remedy any systemic safety issues with the management and performance of the Auckland Terminal sector.",
337,2009_205,016/10,"A culture of poor adherence to safety standards existed on board the Pantas No.1, which possibly extends up through the operator and owner given the design deficiencies for fencing off openings, and the examples of unsafe behaviour exhibited by more than one member of the crew, indicating that this operator might require close regulatory supervision.",
338,2009_005,023/10,"The NOSS showed that the number of communication errors by both controllers and pilots, particularly for the Auckland Terminal sector, was unusually high by international standards. This increases the risk of communication errors contributing to a breakdown in safety standards.
The Commission believes this is a safety issue that the Director needs to address with Airways and recommends that he satisfies himself that Airways' planned Strategic Safety Plan will reduce communication errors and the consequent risk.",
339,2008_110,019/10,"The trainee controller having to refresh his knowledge in double-line automatic signalling rules at the same time as undergoing desk certification complicated the desk certification process, requiring more handovers during a shift. There would be some safety benefits in KiwiRailâ€™s training system for train controllers in specifying a maximum period for which new and returning train controllers can be away from using critical systems such as double-line automatic signalling before requiring refreshing in these systems. Trainee train controllers not being fully current in critical systems, or potentially experienced train controllers returning to using a critical system that they have not used for some time, is a safety issue.",

Each review, by independent bodies external to MNZ, found that the philosophy behind the system was sound, and since the system was introduced safety statistics in all commercial maritime sectors have improved.  While feedback from the industry indicates solid support for the intent of the system MNZ considers that there is still room for improvement in how the system is implemented and delivered by MNZ and SSM companies. 

In line with our continuous improvement policy, a review of the SSM system has been identified as the key strategic priority for MNZ in its 2007-2010 Statement of Intent.  MNZ has commenced a programme of work to enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of the SSM system by:

Ensuring that the regulatory framework supporting SSM is robust and appropriate by reviewing the maritime rules that govern its operation.  A draft discussion document summarising proposed changes to Maritime Rules Part 21 (Safety Management Systems) and Part 46 (Surveys, Certification and Maintenance) is due for public release in late 2007;
Complementing existing guidance material (Health and Safety: A Guide; FishSAFE Health and Safety Guidelines; various leaflets) with additional material including a comprehensive resource to support owners in the development of their SSM systems, specific fatigue management material, and health and safety guidelines for passenger and non-passenger operations.  This additional material is being progressively released through until December 2007 in association with targeted training material;
Increasing the amount and quality of formal and informal training and education that is available to all those working in the system, including MNZ and SSM Company staff, surveyors, owners and operators.  This training will be supported by the development of a mentor network utilising experienced industry participants to provide support and advice to their peers; 
Reviewing the current capacity and quality of service delivery by both MNZ and SSM Companies in the area of SSM and comparing this with requirements in order to identify and address necessary areas for improvement;
Allocating additional resources to the SSM team within MNZ to allow for more responsive contact with industry and other stakeholders, along with the provision of personalised assistance where required to owners and operators; and
Structured auditing by MNZ of SSM service providers.

This work is being actively progressed and monitored within MNZ.  It is also intended to establish an external consultative group to ensure that all industry and other stakeholders remain fully involved with, and aware of, the programme as it is developed and implemented.",

This Section states that imposing conditions on the operation of any rail vehicles must be only if the Director believes, on reasonable grounds, that the operation or use of a rail vehicle or class of rail vehicle, etc., may endanger persons or property and that prompt action is necessary to prevent this risk. At this stage Land Transport NZ is unsure if this threshold for intervention has been met.

We considered this potential risk to passengers best addressed by:

1.  Distributing the Commissionâ€™s Report 05-125 to all operators with operational passenger carriages fitted with non-alliance buffers.

2.  Recommending all above rail operators crack test the non-alliance buffers on all their operational passenger carriages and guards van on a periodic basis.  It would be problematical for Land Transport NZ to require the testing on an annual basis without a specific risk analysis to be carried out by each operator concerned.

Land Transport NZ has decided not to implement the above safety recommendation; however on receipt of your final report we will bring this matter to the individual attention of rail operators concerned as detailed in (1) & (2) above.

Toll NZ considers that the most likely root cause of the fire was a hot cinder from the locomotive exhaust being pulled in through the air intake and sitting on an oil impregnated part of the DA set sound insulation causing it to eventually ignite.

	Investigations carried out have shown that with the air intake filter removed the cooling airflow in the generator enclosure is sufficient.  Regular cleaning takes place every 24,000 km (approximately every three months) and whenever the oil is changed.

Toll NZ considers that the most likely root cause of the fire was a hot cinder from the locomotive exhaust being pulled in through the air intake and sitting on an oil impregnated part of the DA set sound insulation causing it to eventually ignite.

Â·	  The Working Timetable (WTT) instructions would ban wagons being left unattended on the main line.
Â·  	An â€œAll Trains Stop Boardâ€ would be erected just past Owens Siding, defining the limits for normal Industrial Line operations.  Permission for trains to operate past this point will require the issue of a Special Bulletin.
Â·  	The derailing block currently installed on the west end of loop by Owens Siding, protecting the main line would be shown on the S & I diagram, with a special instruction specifying that it must be left locked in the derailing position at all times, and only opened when a train movement is entering or exiting the loop at the west end.

It is considered that the above steps will provide adequate operational and documented safeguards to minimize the risk of future runaways, without resorting to the non-standard solution of providing a derailing block on a main line.  Note that installation of derailing blocks on the main line have historically caused operational problems.
If subsequent experience shows that these arrangements do not result in the require compliance to procedures, NZRC will then reconsider the need for a derailing block, or other protection mechanisms, to prevent runaway wagons form passing over Mays Road Level Crossing and continuing further down the Industrial Line.",

As per our letter of 17th December in response to the preliminary recommendation (which is identical to the final recommendation), we do  not support setting arbitrary time constraints for the reporting of accidents, as this may not reflect the reality of the situation many Masters find themselves in after an accident occurs.

	Section 31 of the Maritime Transport Act 1994 requires mishaps, accidents and incidents to be notified to the authority â€œas soon as practicableâ€ by the Master.

	The current arrangement allows the Master of the vessel to focus on the primary responsibility of ensuring the safety of life, environment and property after an accident rather than being distracted by prescriptive reporting requirements specified within the legislation.  This is particularly so with smaller operators, to whom any amendment to the MTA94 would apply equally to those operators who may have larger resources available.

	We do, however, appreciate that there is some confusion within industry as to the interpretation of â€œas soon as practicableâ€ for the reporting of incidents.

To further this strategy, the Director of Land Transport Safety intends to meet representatives of the relevant territorial authorities and the Auckland Regional Council within the next few weeks to seek a broad agreement on how progress should be made to develop an agreed set of policies, procedures and plans for:
Â·	Closure of any level crossings that are not essential to the road network;
Â·	Grade separation of level crossings where the safety risks and/or the traffic delays are deemed unacceptable, including the setting of priorities;
Â·	The types of protection to be provided at level crossings that remain open;
Â·	The safe use of the fringes of the rail corridor for walkways and cycleways;
Â·	The design and maintenance of fencing of the rail corridor;
Â·	Land use planning adjacent to the rail corridor;
Â·	Publicity and education about the safe use of the rail corridor; and
Â·	Funding of rail corridor safety measures.

The purpose of this work is to ensure an appropriate level of safety in the use of the railway corridor in the Auckland region.
It is intended that once the councils agree on the methodology, the rail operators and infrastructure provider will also be involved in the development of the policies , procedures and plans.  The LTSA will take an observer role, contributing where there is value in doing so, however, the principal responsibility must lie with the railways and the roading authorities.

This review confirmed the LTSA view that a mix of trolley passenger safety measures (rather than one single measure) is the most appropriate approach, depending on the nature of the particular operation.  Possible safety measures, in addition to passenger restraints, include a maximum permitted trolley speed, consideration of location, drawbar design, etc.
In particular, the LTSA can require operators to fit equipment such as restraints if the Director of Land Transport Safety considers it necessary in accordance with the Transport Services Licensing Act 6F, to avoid a significant risk of death or serious injury.  At this stage, the LTSA is unsure if this threshold for intervention has been met.
In addition, given the diversity of trolley operations, the recommendation you make, if universally applied, could very well create new and unforeseen risks.
As such, the LTSA would prefer to continue the work underway in this area.  We are currently working with trolley operators on a case by case basis, assessing their circumstances, and then agreeing on the most effective mix of safety measures.  In some cases this has included the fitting of suitable passenger restraints.
This approach allows the LTSA to avoid having to impose a safety requirement, especially in situations where it could reduce safety.  For these reasons, I regret I am unable to accept your recommendation.",

2003_003,047/03,Boeing,2003-10-24,Implement a FMS software change on all various Boeing aircraft models that ensures any entries (such as V speeds and gross weight) that are mismatched by a small percentage are either challenged or prevented.,Implement a FMS software change on all various Boeing aircraft models that ensures any entries (such as V speeds and gross weight) that are mismatched by a small percentage are either challenged or prevented.,,"According to the NZ TAIC report, the load sheet provided to the crew contained the correct weights for the flight and the correct weight was entered into the FMS.  However, the crew used an incorrect weight to manually calculate the takeoff speeds (V speeds) from airport analysis charts.  The incorrect V speeds were entered into the FMS and used by the crew during takeoff, resulting in the tail strike.

Background
This event is another example of incorrect takeoff speeds, which has previously been identified by Boeing as an issue for the industry.  The common feature among these cases is that the takeoff speeds used by the crew are inappropriate to the specific operating conditions (actual weight, runway length, etc).  The error or errors leading to the incorrect speed can happen at various points along the computational path, which consists of both manual and automated operations.  In all cases, the results are the same - a takeoff is attempted with rotation at an inappropriate speed.  The consequential risks to the airplane (tail strike, overweight takeoff, increased runway length, reduced manoeuvre margin to stall, reduced climb gradient, etc) are the same regardless of the specific error that led to the incorrect V speeds.  Boeing is working to ensure that adequate and appropriate defences are in place to reduce the possibility that such errors are made or propagated. 

Prior to the Auckland event, Boeing had reviewed the takeoff speed calculation procedure, errors that could be introduced and methods to prevent their propagation.  Based on that review, Boeing released the reference (b) Flight Operations Technical Bulletin and the reference (c) Aero Magazine article.  These publications discuss the source of errors, steps taken by Boeing and steps available to operators to prevent the errors from occurring and propagating.  Reference (b) is included with this letter and reference (c) was previously provided to the TAIC.

Discussion
Actions to reduce the occurrence of such of events will be most effective if they address all of the ways in which the error can occur.  Among the incorrect takeoff speed events reported to Boeing, the Auckland event is unique in that the crew entered the correct weight figures in the FMC, but then overwrote the FMC speeds with manually calculated airport-analysis figures.  In the other events reported to Boeing, the weight value entered into the FMC was incorrect, either because incorrect weight information was provided to the crew, or because the crew selected the inappropriate figure from the load sheet (e.g. selecting ZFW and entering it in the GW slot).  The recommended software change to ensure that the speed and weight entries are not mismatched can identify the following two situations:

1.	The crew enters the correct weight but overwrites the FMC-calculated speeds, or
2.	The crew enters an incorrect weight and overwrites the FMC-calculated speeds with correctly calculated V speeds.

The recommended software check would be ineffective in preventing a large proportion of incorrect takeoff speed events - those in which an incorrect weight is entered into the FMC.  Additionally, in the second situation cited above, the takeoff speeds are correct, but the recommended software change could reject or challenge them.  Consideration must be given to the possibility that the crew might then elect to use the incorrect FMC-calculated speeds. 

The takeoff speeds calculated by the FMC are balanced field length speeds which do not take into account the actual runway length, friction conditions, or specific techniques that take advantage of available runway length to gain improved climb performance.  These factors are included in the airport analysis charts which crews use to manually calculate takeoff speeds.  The effect of these factors can be significant.  As an example, the following table lists takeoff speeds for a [Boeing] 737-700:

Model		737-700
Elevation		5330 ft
Runway Length	14,000 ft
Takeoff Weight	141,400 lbs
Temp		30C
Speed		FMC Calculated(kts)	Airport Analysis (Improved Climb)(kts)
V1		140	159
VR		141	162
V2		144	166

In the above example, the manually calculated speeds are approximately 20 knots faster than the FMC-calculated speeds.  In the case of low runway friction, the manually calculated V1 speed can be up to 20 knots slower than FMS-calculated speeds.  Thus, there are cases where the manually calculated speeds differ by more than a small percentage from the FMC-calculated speeds.  The recommended software check would challenge or reject these valid entries creating nuisance warnings to the crew.  Nuisance warnings reduce the effectiveness of a warning system and can defeat the original purpose of the warning system.  We are, however, exploring the possibility of checking that the manually entered VR speed is not significantly lower than the FMC-calculated value.  It appears that narrowing the check in this manner may produce the intended safety benefit while avoiding some of the problems mentioned above.

Boeing Action
Boeing will continue to examine the safety recommendation in the context of the broader issue regarding incorrect takeoff speeds.  As the work progresses, we will determine whether changes to existing FMS installations may be warranted.  Separately, we will also determine if such new features should be included in new FMS installations.  At this point, no schedule has been set for the completion of our examination.",

Eastland Port has reservations about the appropriateness of PIANC Guidelines in this regard and, as indicated above, is commissioning independent marine experts to carry out a Risk Assessment for the port which will address these issues.

It is not possible at this stage to indicate when Eastland Port will be in a position to decide whether or not to implement the recommendation.  That will depend on the timing and contents of the Risk Assessment report.

However, it is important to record that Eastland Port has adopted the following requirement, which was promulgated by Port Gisborne Limited on 20th February 2003 to all port users.   It will continue to remain in force until Eastland Port has taken decisions following the completion of the Risk Assessment.

That, Ships of 150 m LOA and above are required to be assisted by two tugs unless otherwise directed by the Pilot.

That, Ships greater than 175 LOA but less than 200 LOA may transit in and out of port if the following criteria are all satisfied:

i.     Swell conditions in the channel and port are less than  2 metres in height; and
ii.	   The cross wind conditions in the channel less than 15 knots;  and
iii.	   There is an under-keel clearance of at least 2 metres;  and
iv.	  The shipâ€™s transit is during daylight hours;  and
v.    Conditions of unrestricted visibility prevail:  and
vi.   	The Harbourmaster is in attendance at the port of Gisborne and the Pilot and the Harbourmaster have conducted a risk assessment of weather conditions and ship particulars before the vessel enters or departs the port of Gisborne;  and
vii.	  The Harbourmaster is to closely monitor weather and sea conditions and the weather and swell forecast while the ship is berthed at the port of Gisborne in order to determine whether there is any risk from weather which may result in the ship being unable to leave the port.",

As a consequence of that audit the MSA made certain recommendations regarding the organisation of Harbourmaster services at Gisborne.

Council is co-operating with the MSA to ensure that a satisfactory solution to Harbourmaster issues is put in place and is continuing to work on those issues.

In particular, Council sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons by advertising both in Gisborne and on a national basis.  There was limited response.  Only one Gisborne resident with suitable experience responded.  While there were responses from two Master Mariners, one lived in Tauranga and the other in Kati Kati and neither was prepared to move to Gisborne to take up limited part time employment.

On 12 May 2003 Council engaged the services of [the Gisborne applicant] to assist the Harbourmaster by providing local representation.  [The Gisborne applicantâ€™s] credentials are as follows:

1)	he has recently retired after 25 yearsâ€™ service with the Royal New Zealand Navy having reached the rank of warrant officer and held a Grade 3 Bridge Watchkeeping Certificate for the last seven years.

2)	he has extensive OOW experience over the last seven years around the New Zealand coast.

3)	he has considerable experience in hydrographic survey work with the Royal New Zealand Navy and as a consequence has expert knowledge in this area and useful contacts with the relevant Government agencies.

[He] has been engaged on a retainer but directed to work on an â€œas requiredâ€ basis without any restriction being placed on his hours of work.  He will have assistance from the Harbourmaster and Chief Environmental Health Officer who is also an enforcement officer at the Port.  It is proposed that over the next three months [he] will undergo training and gain experience which may result in it being appropriate to appoint him as Deputy Harbourmaster.

Ongoing steps are being taken to ensure that the Harbourmaster is supported by at least a Deputy Harbourmaster based in Gisborne.  Council will continue to monitor the availability of suitable personnel who may be sufficiently qualified and experienced to be appointed as Deputy Harbourmaster should [he] not for any reason ultimately fill that role.

I trust from the above the Commission will accept that the provision of additional support for the Harbourmaster at Gisborne will enable him to be employed on terms and conditions which enable him to properly fulfil the statutory function of the position at all material times.",

Eastland Port in conjunction with the Harbour Master, has determined the depth limits for the channel at 10.3m.  On 17th April 2003 this was promulgated to all relevant parties, including Pilot, Agents and port users.

This limit was established after:

a dredging program conducted by NZ Dredging and General Works between 20th March and 9th April 2003.

a survey carried out by Hunter Hydrographic on 9th April 2003, which confirms the depth in the channel was between 10.3 and 11m.  The Harbourmaster and Pilot are in receipt of these surveys.

Included in the Procedures Manual previously referred is a stipulation that surveys be carried out by in-house personnel at the end of each month, and that a monthly program of 5-6 days dredging be performed by the dredge owned by Eastland Port to remedy any in-filling which has occurred at the commencement of each month.

Additionally, the Procedures Manual stipulates that Eastland Port will contract an independent hydrographic surveyor at 4-month intervals.

It is anticipated that these measures will ensure that the channel remains at an operation depth of at least 10.3m on an ongoing basis, and provide the new owners with a data base of hydrographic surveys going forward.",

A team comprised of CentrePort marine consultants, Gisborne Pilot and linesmen, intend to visit New Plymouth port during May and review the mooring system employed by Westgate, with a view to formulating a best practice mooring and linesmen training system for Gisborne.

Eastland Port believe that it would be prudent to defer any implementation of such a revised system until the Independent Risk Assessment is carried out, during which the present practice and any proposed revision to that practice will be critically analysed.

Once a best practice system has been determined and critically reviewed, Eastland Port intend to replace all existing ships lines (except Lanyards â€“ see item 2 below) and purchase sufficient lines of the appropriate configuration to enable such a system to be introduced.",

The top of the vinyl doors to the carriages is to have a stiffening aluminium rod placed in it.

As for your recommendation on child resistant locking devices is concerned, any locking device on the door needs to be simple enough to allow urgent egress from the train whilst it is in a tunnel, should any emergency occur.  Rather than having a childproof locking device, Watercare proposes to install switching equipment on the door locks so that if the door lock is lifted or tampered with in any way, the train immediately comes to a halt. 

Watercare is firmly of the view that the further safety enhancements to the Rain Forest Express identified above are well in excess of those recommended in your letter.",

- the deed of grant contains appropriate conditions that ensure public safety
- the appropriate signage for a public level crossing status is in place.",,"Tranz Rail needs to undertake further work to determine to what extent it is possible to implement this recommendation.  Tranz Rail has a database of ""known"" private level crossings (approximately 700 in number).  However, when a property is sold or changes hands, Tranz Rail has no way of knowing that this has occurred, as it is not informed.  In such a situation, the Deed of Grant permitting use of the private level crossing would become invalid since it is a private agreement between Tranz Rail and the owner of the property and does not pass to the new owner with the title to the land.  A new owner should, under law, then apply to Tranz Rail for its own Deed of Grant.  Tranz Rail is planning to review the terms of the Deed of Grant to include an obligation to notify Tranz Rail of a change in ownership, but Tranz Rail has no way of enforcing this.  In addition, there are a number of statutory private level crossings which are granted to farmers and the like by statute and which Tranz Rail also has no record of.

Tranz Rail intends to write to known private level crossing owners who have a Deed of Grant to remind them of their obligations under the Deed of Grant and to ask them to notify us of any public use of their crossings.  Public use is prohibited under the Deed of Grant without Tranz Railâ€™s consent.  Tranz Rail then intends to deal with each known case of public use, by requiring the holder to erect appropriate signage, where this is the appropriate course of action.  Unfortunately, it is the private holder and not Tranz Rail who is in the best position to monitor public use of the crossings and to this extent is reliant upon the compliance of the holders to the terms of their grant.

In addition, Tranz Rail also intends to amend its Deed of Grant to all new holders, to refer to the appropriate signage which should be put up in compliance with LTSA standards for the protection of level crossings with public use.

Further work is also required to determine the role of track inspections and now they can identify the status of private level crossings.

This is an ongoing project for Tranz Rail and the company is committed to following it through to all extents reasonably possible.",

Service Bulletins are produced by the manufacturer and after advice from the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (NZCAA), there is no mandatory requirement to satisfy overseas manufacturer's Service Bulletins for General Aviation aircraft unless they are reproduced as Airworthiness Directives.

Flightline Aviation does however - as a reputable and professional organisation obtain, view and generally advise customers of the existence of manufacturerâ€™s Service Bulletins.  Service Bulletins are received and assessed for applicability so that the customer has the option of accepting or rejecting their intent.

The issue has raised the point that there is general confusion within the aviation industry of whether, for example, a manufacturerâ€™s Service Bulletin is actually mandatory within NZ and must be satisfied.  Reference A relates to a conversation with the NZCAA and confirmation was obtained regarding the General Aviation requirements relating to Service Bulletins.  In short, there is no requirement for NZ maintenance organisations to abide by manufacturerâ€™s Service Bulletins (mandatory or otherwise) unless directed via a NZ Airworthiness Directive.

During the maintenance process the defect information changed regularly, and based on past experience, Flightline staff acted reasonably in light of the information on hand.

The intent of the safety recommendation refers specifically to this one engine type.  â€œTrouble-shooting procedures and comprehensive fault diagnosis for repeated component changesâ€™ relates not to only this one task but all trouble-shooting tasks.

This process is now completed and the review team have passed its recommendations, after considering the comments received, to the Manager Safety and Environment Standards, to commence formal industry consultation for amendment of Maritime Rule Part 80.

The issue of twin propulsion (engine) systems was seriously considered by the review team for high adventure operations.

Indeed the review team made note in section 13.4 that:

â€œThe compulsory use of lap belts and twin engine boats for high adventure activities should be regularly reviewed by MSA in light of operational experience.â€

The review team did not include twin engine boats for high adventure activities in its recommendations, as it was not satisfied that such a recommendation would meet the MSAâ€™s charter of â€œA Safe and Clean Maritime Environment at reasonable costâ€, where â€œReasonable Costâ€ is defined in Section 430(b) of the Maritime Transportation Act 1994 as a meaning, â€œwhen the value of the Cost to the nation is exceeded by the value of the resulting benefit to the nation.â€

As part of the review process, reported accidents were considering along with possible initiatives which could have prevented the accident from occurring.  ON the basis of that study, and bearing in mind MSAâ€™s charter, the review team determined the compulsory use of twin engine boats for high adventure activities did not achieve the â€œReasonable Costâ€ criteria.

Comments received from industry as a result of the consultation document would also support this view.

The review team nor MSA have not dismissed the concept of twin engine boats, rather it is our view that this technology should be embraced as it is developed, and operators be encouraged to adopt it as the technical challenges are overcome.

MSA is working with Shotover Jet, industry in general and the New Zealand Commercial Jet Boat Association to achieve this goal.

Considering the above we regret to advise that MSA is not able to accept the final recommendation 033/01.",

Tranz Railâ€™s internal investigation identified further differentiating the sequence of signals approaching Te Maunga would enhance the advanced warning available to a Locomotive Engineer should the route be inadvertently set for the lesser speed turnout to the Mt Maunganui line.

A proposal has been discussed with local Locomotive Engineer representatives and has been accepted.  However, before proceeding with installation, Tranz Rail is considering further an additional enhancement that could alleviate any further opportunity for confusion when approaching the preceding signal governing entry to the crossing loop.  This review and further local consultation is expected to be complete by the end of August 2001.

Subsequent design and installation is expected to be complete by the end of November 2001.  The design work involves providing a flashing aspect on a search light type signal that is more complicated than similar flashing aspect designs already in place on Tranz Railâ€™s network.
The Company Rules Committee had also identified the need to consider other sites where altering the sequence of signals could provide an additional defence against incorrect route settings.  This review has commenced and is expected to be complete by the end of September 2001, with a view of programming changes on a priority basis.

MSA does not support this view.  The intent of the Rule was that a quick release mechanism should be installed within the towline.  We are, however, considering additional wording in Clause 40.60 to clarify this matter.

Paragraph 2.26 discusses the use of an axe as a means of quick release.  It should be noted that Maritime Rule Part 40C is intended for all non-passenger ships that are not SOLAS ships.  This includes small work boats which may be utilised in towing operations and an axe is an appropriate means of quick release.

In the case in question, the use of an axe to the release the line would be ineffective and an alternative means of release should have been provided.

Infrastructure Staff:  

â€œWork Site Protection Safety â€“ Infrastructure work sites often involve a large number of people to  perform a task.  As a result, on Person in Charge may have a large number of staff to co-ordinate over a long area.  The safety of Infrastructure and train operating staff is the most important concern for all the people connected with the protection of a work site.

Persons in Charge should manage their work site by maintaining a regular communication with Train Control and being conscious not to be pressured to let trains pass at the expense of ensuring all staff are clear and track is safe.  Should communication between all persons on a work site be difficult, this must not prevent the Person in Charge from ensuring the site is completely safe for a train to pass.

It is accepted on occasion delays will be unavoidable due to work complications and the necessity to ensure the line is safe and clear.

This item is due to be issued in a newsletter week commencing 6 August 2001.

Tranz Rail accept items 1 to 3 of this recommendation.  As a result of our internal investigation the following actions have been completed or are in progress:

1.  On 18 June 2001 Tranz Rail revised the Engineering Rules.  The following specific rules define the requirements for all work groups and apply to multiple work groups within Conditional Stop Protection:

â€¢  Rule 900(e) provides a definition of a Person in Charge.
â€¢  Rule 901(a) specifies the communication tools and how communication is to be made.
â€¢  Rule 902 specifies the procedure for ensuring it is safe for protection to be passed.
â€¢  Rule 905(e) defines the procedure for obstructing the line with Conditional Stop Protection and for the Person in Charge to authorise work within the protection.

The rules listed above are written to provide specific requirements for the safe operation of all work, irrespective of and not limiting the number of work groups included under one set of  protection.  These rules allow for only one Person in Charge of protection.  This ensures all work is protected and authorised in a safe and consistent manner.

2.  Engineering Rule 902 has defined the procedure to be followed when protecting multiple work groups and covers the intent of the first part if this recommendation.  Tranz Rail has developed a draft Site Control Sheet to assist the Person in Charge in managing all staff under his control.  This was initiated on 28 May 2001 as a result of the companyâ€™s internal investigation.

3.  A draft Site Control Sheet has been developed and includes the items listed.  Tranz Rail are currently working to define and document a process for its use.

This review identified consistent opinion regarding sequences of night shifts.  More specifically, there is now a view that the number of night shifts in rotating rosters should be confined to three, and in the case of permanent night shift, six.  Tranz Rail Locomotive Engineers work to rotating rosters.

The literature also recognised the importance of a recovery period following a sequence of night shifts to restore sleep debt accumulated during these shifts.

The information was first reviewed by the Locomotive Engineersâ€™ Council (a joint Tranz Rail/Rail Maritime and Transport Workers Union forum) at their 10/11 May meeting.  It has subsequently been decided to prepare rosters with sequences of night shifts confined to three followed by mandatory time off.  These rosters will be piloted in four depots.

Toward the end of the pilot period (likely to be several months) Locomotive Engineers working these rosters will be surveyed to identify if they have found the revised rostering principles more beneficial.

It is expected the pilot period will commence during August 2001 and the review will take place in late October/early November 2001.

A final decision regarding a permanent change to these rostering principles will be made following an analysis of the results of the pilot and further discussion within the Locomotive Engineerâ€™s Council.",

These advisory circulars would address technical issues illustrated by this accident, and provide an expansion of the Rule requirements (including a clear expression of the need to report â€œmajor alterationsâ€ or ""major repairs"" to the MSA) for both SSM companies and operators.

MSA would also note that it is our intention to further define the terms ""major alterations"" or ""major repairs"" in the amendments being considered to Rule Part 21.",

The company has approached these matters in the following manner:

a.  Of its own volition, immediately following the accidents involving Shotover 14 and 15, SJL as a matter of urgency internally identified those components that it considered were critical.  The definition of â€œcriticalâ€ was that the failure of them would have a high probability of leading to an incident or accident.  These critical components were replaced during the fleet upgrade earlier in 2000 and identified with an installation date stamp.  The total operational hours of each craft were noted at the time and the hours since are logged, enabling SJL to accurately record the operational hours of each component as well as the individual history of the component.

b.  The second step in this process has been the contracting out to an independent, suitably qualified expert a detailed identification of all critical components and the assessment of a reasonable life expectancy of those components.  These procedures are based largely on the aviation industry.  Obviously the system provides for mandatory replacement or critical assessment once the nominated time limits are reached.  A good example of this is the Hamilton 212 nozzle where this item was identified as critical.  A limit of 500 hours was initially identified before crack testing took place but recent concerns have seen this limit lowered to 250 hours.  On completion of the assessment process, all parts will be stamped with a unique identifier enabling lifetime tracing.

SJL also considers that the intent of this question is to examine all aspects of the business including training, standard and type of craft, maintenance, decision making operational conditions, ""drive lines"" and all other relevant factors.  The company engaged in a thorough process of examining all aspects of its business in April 1999, but which continues now on an ongoing basis.  As a result of the implementation of this programme, many of the issues raised in the draft report have already been dealt with and new systems and procedures put in place.

As an initial step in reviewing the content of the companyâ€™s jet boat trips, an extensive Risk Management Assessment evaluation has been completed.

Specific issues [were] undertaken (completed and ongoing) as part of the critical review of trip content.  As part of the companyâ€™s Q20/20 system of reviewing its operations, the company has made a number of changes to its procedures, its craft, and its training and maintenance systems.  These measures were accelerated as a result of the accidents involving Shotover 14 and Shotover 15 in October and November 1999, and as a result of the unsatisfactory audits of the SJL fleet earlier in 2000.  In brief, these issues are:

Existing fleet

After undergoing three external audits and several internal audits identifying areas where the fleet required upgrading, all existing craft in all subsidiaries in SJL have been upgraded to ensure, at minimum, compliance with MSA Rule Part 80.

The only exceptions are the exemptions referred to in [our response to safety recommendation 069/00] as granted by the Director of Maritime Safety.

Apart from issues of compliance with MSA Rule Part 80, all craft have been critically reviewed in the interests of ensuring compliance with good engineering practices.

Regular reviews are taking place to ensure that the programme of off-season upgrade of craft is consistent with the timetable presented to the Director of Maritime Safety in April 2000.

Despite the decision to replace the fleet at Shotover Jet Queenstown (SJQ) within the next 12 to 18 months, the fleet at SJQ currently consists of two craft less than one year old, two craft which are older but which have been subjected to complete strip and refurbishment to ""as new"" condition and will see the introduction before the end of the calendar year 2000 of two brand new craft of the existing design.  Other remaining craft have been substantially upgraded and reviewed as part of the process described earlier.

In view of the lack of suitable standards governing LPG installations, SJL had contracted an expert in the field of LPG management and installation to advise on installations in SJL boats.  This arrangement was made despite the fact that LPG is likely to be phased out as a fuel at SJQ within the next 12 months and at Huka Jet Limited (HJL) within two years.  Any recommendations by the LPG expert will be incorporated into the existing fleet.

All major changes and structural componentry will be approved by an external qualified professional engineer.

Technical

SJL has made substantial changes to the make up and numbers of personnel at its workshops at Queenstown, Glenorchy and Taupo.  SJL considered that the staffing levels were adequate but has approximately doubled its technical staff numbers in the past eight months.

The decision to expand capacity recognises the work required to bring the existing fleet up to standard, as well as a desire to consistently exceed the standards set in MSA Rule Part 80.

SJL now operates four workshops: SJQ in Queenstown, Dart River Jet Safaris Glenorchy and HJL in Taupo with a boat refurbishment/major maintenance division at the Frankton Marina, Queenstown.

Technical staff rosters have been changed to ensure availability of technical staff to participate in after operation checks and urgent maintenance required to be done overnight prior to re-commencement of operations the next day.

Qualifications of technical staff have been reviewed to assess their suitability.

New workshop manuals have been drawn up using external professional assistance.

Systems

A new boat checking system is now in place.  Craft are signed off jointly by a driver and technician.

All operational staff have been retrained in boat inspections and the critical areas to be observed.

All operational staff have been retrained to ensure that boat checks are capable of identifying problems rather than a system which simply ticks off lists of observations.

A system of ""surprise"" audits is now in place where all operations are subject to four internal checks per year (in addition to the MSA external checks) with one internal check undertaken by an independent suitably qualified expert.

SJL has introduced a system of monitoring incidents where any incident, no matter how small, is analysed, logged and reviewed with results monitored by SJL management and board.  This system allows cross referencing of incidents which occur involving specific drivers, craft, components, sections of the rivers, manoeuvres etc to observe any recurrent factors.  The system is designed to reduce incident occurrence to a minimum.

An aviation based safety engineer is to be appointed to the Audit and Compliance Committee of the SJL Board to assist and advise on issues of safety and compliance.

All critical components are now internally identified and date stamped on installation for replacement at the ""use by"" date.

SJL has contracted a suitably qualified external expert to examine the list of critical components drawn up internally, adding items where appropriate and providing an assessment of the componentsâ€™ operational life times.  This system is designed around that used in the aviation industry.

SJL has re-engineered the companyâ€™s maintenance systems to provide for replacement of critical components as required by ""lifetime"" assessments.

SJL has re-engineered the companyâ€™s maintenance systems to ensure the periodic testing of critical components by suitably qualified independent experts.

Personnel

SJL has critically reviewed driver-training systems and introduced changes where necessary.

SJL has critically reviewed the system of checking drivers (particularly new drivers) by the senior driver and confirmed it as adequate.

SJL has reinforced the driversâ€™ option to operate or otherwise depending on conditions.

SJL has reinforced to operational staff, and in particular drivers, their responsibility for boat condition and the decision whether or not to operate craft.

SJL has introduced a system of psychological assessment for new drivers.

Operations

SJL has reviewed all aspects of its subsidiariesâ€™ trips to ensure strict adherence to company specified ""drive lines"".

SJL has reviewed the appropriateness of â€œdrive linesâ€ internally and with a suitably qualified independent expert.

SJL has reinforced drivers need to adopt a more conservative line in high water conditions.

SJL has discussed with operational staff any suggested changes and implemented them where appropriate.

SJL has reviewed the adequacy of its safety briefings.

SJL has reassessed its safety equipment and made improvements where appropriate.

SJL has reviewed the companyâ€™s Safe Operating Plan and rewritten it.  It is now MSA/QLDC Harbourmaster approved.

SJL has reviewed its crisis management plan and confirmed that it is adequate.

SJL has reviewed its pre-departure facilities and upgraded these where appropriate.

Hamilton 212 Jet Units

SJL has, immediately after the Shotover 15 accident discarded all Hamilton 212 ""Mk I"" nozzles and replaced these with ""Mk II"" [nozzles].

SJL has commissioned a comprehensive independent report from a suitably qualified professional engineer on the design of Hamilton 212 jet unit [steering nozzles].

The report concluded the [steering nozzle] is under designed for its function.

Copies of the independent report have been provided to appropriate authorities.

SJL has requested a complete redesign of the 212 nozzle by CWF Hamilton.

Pending a complete redesign, SJL has commissioned external professional advice on the continued use of Mark II 212 nozzles.

SJL continues to use Mark II nozzles subject to rigorous daily inspections, and removal for crack testing at 250-hour intervals.

SJL has fitted steering stops to all SJL craft using Hamilton 212 units.

New Craft

SJL has completed a review of all design aspects of existing craft and elected to replace virtually its entire fleet.

While existing craft are adequate, it is recognised that they are evolutions of craft introduced in the 1970â€™s and it is time for a complete redesign.

The only common factor between new craft and existing craft is the shape of the below water hull.

Two prototype boats are now under construction at Dickson Marine of Nelson.

Depending on the success of these craft, a contractual agreement will be entered into to construct between 20 and 25 craft of the new design.

A critical path for delivery will see Dart River Jet Safaris and SJQ fleets replaced by June 2002.

The SJL board has approved a capital expenditure programme to cover the new boats.

Extensive external testing of a Kevlar carborundum composite material has proved satisfactory, with strength, weight and durability factors far exceeding those of comparable aluminium, resulting in a decision to construct hulls from this material.

The new craft will include ergonomically designed seats to assist with passenger safety and comfort with ""soft"" plastic fittings internally to protect passengers.

The new craft will incorporate crumple zones in bows, ""positive buoyancy cell"" and redesigned fuel systems to improve safety incorporating â€œanti explosionâ€ fuel tanks.

The steering systems will be completely redesigned to incorporate a system of shafts and gearboxes replacing existing cables and pulleys.   The new system will be considerably more robust, easier to maintain and less susceptible to failure.  The system has been designed by a professional engineer and certified.

The motor and jet unit packages have been considered and this is likely to result in a decision (after testing) to install twin engines and twin jet units to improve safety through duplicated systems, allowing continuation of one engine/jet unit in the event of failure of the other.

All equipment installed in boats will be either certified by a suitably qualified professional engineer or will carry suitable manufacturer warranties.

Seatbelts

SJL has commissioned an extensive and comprehensive external report on the installation of seatbelts.

If installation proceeds, it will be in conjunction with an ""automatic release"" system, which provides for release in the event of swamping of the craft or by central driver control as well as individual passenger control.

A final decision on this issue will be made when all factors including an independent report have been considered.",

We found clear evidence that the steering crank was jamming in the nozzle arm before the nozzle could reach full lock in the same way as the failed Shotover nozzle.  For this to happen the nozzle had to sustain considerable damage and for the steering system to be operated in this condition once again indicates a serious lack of maintenance.",

CTL would be greatly assisted if TAIC could
[a] spell out what risk assessments should be carried out and at what current locations, and
[b] assure CTL that other companies contemplating such arrangements are to be subject to similar scrutiny.

CTL notes in passing that the trend for CTL and others is that any future new or existing vessels are likely to be bigger than current new or existing vessels.

With regard to my comment [a] above, if TAIC has in mind simulation studies, for example on the AMC simulator at Launceston, Tasmania, then I would like to add the following.  A decision to model an earlier sister ship to Kakariki  i.e. the Helix on the AMC simulator had to be reviewed when it was found the 2 vessels had dis-similar handling characteristics in service.  The decision to model Kakariki  itself was then taken, but implementation was delayed due to confidentiality issues with regard to her Schilling rudder.  Kakariki  has been so modelled since early 2000, and a joint session between CTL and POL [Port Otago Limited] has been scheduled at AMC in July 2000.

A final point to note in this regard is that assessments using the AMC simulator are subject to the relevant port agreeing to its port modelling being released.  CTL places no restrictions on the availability of the Kakariki  model for such purposes, nor does it charge for such release.  Currently, only 4 ports in New Zealand reciprocate on that basis, 2 ports have refused such use, and another would like a financial arrangement to be entered into.  I am informed that Australian ports that are modelled at AMC make their modelling freely available to anyone in the world, free of charge.  In CTL's view this situation warrants a ministerial and/or regulatory review in its own right as a pre-requisite to any recommendations made by TAIC and/or MSA [Maritime Safety Authority] which require CTL and/or SFSL to utilise ""currently available technology"" to conduct risk assessments within New Zealand ports.",

The need to further ascertain proper compliance of the SMS with ISM Code requirements during the effective period of the DOC has already been recognized, and the efforts are currently underway at both IACS and the IMO to address this issue on a broader spectrum.  IACS has been preparing a draft proposal for submission to the IMO setting forth, amongst other things, circumstances under which additional verification audits can be carried out of a company and its ships.  This includes development of a new requirement for implementation of annual audits of all ships detained by PSC for ISM Code related deficiencies for a period of at least three years.  ClassNK fully supports these efforts.  It might also be pointed out that such audits could also serve as a means of targeting problematic ships better than the random audits suggested in SR 010-00.  When conducting such annual audits, special care can also be given to the steps taken by the company to ensure adequate communication onboard ship.",

- A visit has already been made on 9 March 2000 of the company that managed the subject ship at the time of the incident (Shikishima Kisen K.K.) to confirm the adequate implementation of its SMS with particular emphasis on shipboard communication.  Recommendations were made that the company is currently working to resolve.

- Additional audits are to be carried out for all ships under the management of Shikishima Kisen K.K. (currently eight vessels) to ensure compliance with company SMS and ISM Code requirements with particular attention to steps taken to ensure effective communications onboard.  The company has already agreed to the audits (expected to be completed within about six months or so depending on ship schedules, etc.).

- The Pacific Princess has already undergone a full SMS audit along with the company that is now managing the vessel, which was completed on 17 November 1999 in Korea.  Based on a careful analysis of the incident as presented in your report and our own information, ClassNK has been reviewing and expanding the current checklist used to conduct ISM audits, especially with respect to confirming the steps taken by companies to ensure effective shipboard communication.  This also includes the preparation of a special checklist for carrying out the additional audits of the ships described above. 

 -  A circular is being issued to all auditors emphasizing the need for special attention to onboard communications and reminding them of the importance of exercising proper care in the conduct of all audits.

We see this as vital to a people oriented operation.

Our pilots have a business type card that they have to give to every passenger carried by them.  As you can see [from an enclosed example] the pilot is not only identified by name but also by his photograph, the company name and address and contact telephone number are clear and even the aircraft in [the pilot's] case is depicted.  To my knowledge we are the only operator who do this.

In over thirty years of flying you can imagine I have flown every relative of mine, many hundreds of friends, and indeed since 1982 Waterwings has had a stated policy of all locals fly free.

Our pilots continually fly my friends, acquaintances, relations, many local people, and overseas visitors to my home.  Whenever this happens I always ask, ""What was the trip like?"" and ""What was the pilot like?""

We have very good procedure monitoring systems in place such as regular pilots safety meetings, and those set out above.  These systems are currently being documented.  The CAA in due course ought to be able to provide these to you once the approval has been given.

Our new, soon to be released (hopefully) exposition very fully sets out the systems by which we will document and implement these.  For instance every time a friend or relation flies with a pilot their reactions to the above questions will be noted on the individual pilot files that we have always kept.

My company is a very small operation and we have always been a very close-knit unit, doing what we do together and always striving to be better.

 We believe we have always adopted these recommendations and acted in accordance with them.

As stated, we are awaiting approval by the CAA of our documentation, which will be implemented as soon as CAA has appraised it.

In addition to the above I would like to point out that the Milford Sound and Queenstown Users Liaison Group (monitored by the CAA at every meeting) have a safety officer system compiled of one pilot from every company (who cannot be management staff), who form a separate committee to observe and note any incidents or safety issues.  These if serious are brought to the notice of operators immediately or if of a less serious nature are promulgated at regular meetings.",

During the 1980's the Code of Practice driver training hours was 100 hours, this was subsequently reduced to 50 hours in consultation with the Industry by the Queenstown Lakes District Council when the Bylaws were adopted.  The reason for this was it was not accepted by the industry hence the Council adopted 50 hours in the Bylaws when they were adopted, before a full license was issued.  The recommendation that drivers obtain a standard before they can be certified as Senior drivers and that drivers have on going guidance/training is supported, however as Rule 80 stands there is not requirement for any operator to ensure his staff is given the above.  As you are no doubt aware in Queenstown jet boat drivers are issued with a full license, it seems somewhat ridiculous that once Rule 80 becomes law on July 14 the Council will not be able to issue licenses.  The [Association] totally supports drivers under going 50 hours of training on each river they intend to operate on.  The [Association] does not support the recommendation of fitting Roll Bars in commercial jet boats, as they could cause a jet boat to roll a second time thus exposing passengers to even greater risk.  A foil/ducktail would be more practical but this also would need to be designed around the jet boat and is not something that could just be fitted to every jet boat.  To summarise:  the [Association] supports in part the recommendations, as detailed, i.e. the 50 hour training requirement.  Further analysis is required on the other items.

The Recommendation, whilst it may go some way to preventing a further occurrence of this kind, will nevertheless bring with it a number of other considerations which, on balance, may show that it is not cost beneficial and imposes a significant workload to bring up to date the large number of existing aircraft Flight Manuals.  There is also likely to be a degree of difficulty in defining both optional and operational significance, as used in the Recommendation.

It should also be born in mind that the responsibility for ensuring that a pilot undergoing a type conversion is competent rests with the (industry) instructor giving that endorsement training.  That training is not limited to flight time but should also include extensive discussion, briefing and training on the aircraft and all its fitted systems.  The endorsement is not complete until the instructor has ensured that the endorsee is fully familiar with all systems and operating parameters of the aircraft.

Notwithstanding these comments, the CAA is prepared to adopt this Recommendation in principle as a petition for rule-making and submit it to the rule-making process.

The worst case scenario is a function of Significant Wave Height and Wave Period.  It can be extremely difficult to visually estimate wave period, especially at different headings and speeds.  That is why our table only refers to significant wave height.  For each wave height band, the speed limit is determined for the worst case wave period but due to the above mentioned difficulties in observation the speed limit applied to all wave periods within that band.  For a vessel that is classed to be able to trade in numerous locations around the world it is not possible to do a full analysis of the effect of wave period on the safe operation of each craft.  This is because of the difficulty in taking into account all the local factors that may influence the vessel response, such as shoaling, adverse currents, thermoclines, etc.  Thus, the Speed Wave height curve is based on fully developed seas.  If, due to the local variations, normal wave steepness limits are exceeded it is the Masters responsibility to ensure the vessel is handled in a prudent manner.  We would have assumed that the principles of prudent seamanship would not need to be reiterated, as it is one of the fundamental requirements of a Ship's Master.  With regard to your final safety recommendation, we would state that due regard is already given to the effect of different wave periods in normal operation.  We would also comment that our Rules and Procedures are being constantly monitored and updated and your comments are noted as part of this process.  In particular, if we have regular occurrences of prudent seamanship not being observed we will examine the issuance of a Classification Circular or Casualty Note to all Owners of High Speed Craft classed with DNV.",

This is in line with regulatory philosophy that the new Rule is intended to establish an environment where responsible persons in industry would make decisions that were appropriate for each individual occasion.

It appears that, in some cases, this objective may not be being achieved.

Overall, the CAA perceives that this event has raised queries about a number of current practices or requirements.  These include:
â€¢  whether it is appropriate to accept Part 43 Appendix C as an acceptable regime for maintenance if the manufacturer has promulgated a maintenance schedule or programme for the aircraft, particularly where the aircraft is used on air transport operations;
â€¢  clarification and reinforcement of just what is meant or required by ""On condition"" maintenance., This does NOT, as some seem to believe, mean use it until it fails and then replace it.  It means inspect it and check and/or test it so that you are satisfied that it will perform its function at least until the next inspection is due; and
â€¢  any requirement applied to fuel hoses in the engine compartment should also consider whether it is appropriate to place similar requirements on other hoses in that compartment.  It is suggested that at least the oil hoses and, for IFR operations, the vacuum hoses are just as vital for safe operations as the fuel hoses.

The CAA has recently conducted a review throughout the country of the standard of maintenance of aircraft below 5700 kg. This was partly triggered by the inflow of information that came about with the initial requirement for an Annual Review of Airworthiness (ARA) inspection of GA aircraft and the inflow of a number of other pieces of information . This information and the resultant findings support the positions expressed earlier.

A working group has been established with members from both CAA and industry to review maintenance of aircraft in this category and the Final Recommendation will be passed to them for review. The initial meeting of the Group is today.

The CAA adopts the recommendation.  The initial forum for the consideration will be the joint working group described above.  I will advise you further of the outcomes of that review.",

â€¢  is required by the port company and city council, and 
â€¢  is consistent with national and international trends and guidelines.",,"Port Nelson Limited has some difficulty with this recommendation.  As with most other services in the port, Port Nelson Limited competes for the piloting service.  Port Nelson Limited has embarked on a contract with the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, Tasmania to have the port of Nelson fully simulated.  This simulation will be used by Port Nelson Limited pilots to gain skills in emergency procedures, such as ships blacking out in the channel, sudden changes in environmental factors, helm being wrongly applied, and the like.  The cost of setting up the port simulation is high, as is the daily cost for the pilots to practice in the simulator.  In addition, Port Nelson Limited is committed to sending its pilots on bridge resource management (BRM) courses, again, at some considerable cost.  Port Nelson Limited may, at its discretion, make the port simulation available to other pilots; however, the daily costs for running the simulator, and the cost of bridge resource management training would have to be met by them.  Although port simulation and BRM are consistent with international trends, and Port Nelson Limited is providing training for its pilots using these techniques, it feels that it is unable to force the concept on to other pilots operating in the port, until such time as they become in some way mandatory.  Having said that, Port Nelson Limited has recently entered into a memorandum of understanding with Tasman Bay Pilots in which it is stated that either company will provide pilots for the other if the circumstances dictate.  The memorandum contains the clause:  ""Bridge Resource Management - Port Nelson Limited pilots practise BRM techniques.  As a minimum requirement, when Tasman Bay Pilots are contracted to Port Nelson Limited, their pilots must produce a passage plan for the ship master and brief the bridge team of the ship prior to conducting the act.""",

The meeting also agreed unanimously that the Association/TAIC/MSA should look at the following to improve passenger safety in commercial jet boats:  1.  Passenger compartment should be user friendly, i.e. padding in all areas, no sharp seat front edges, no sharp hand rail supports, legs of passengers at the proper angle so passengers can brace themselves, feet/legs cannot go under seat frames/drivers seat, dash area in front seating area properly designed etc.  2.  Driver training, jet boat companies should have a more stringent assessment system (i.e. Police check, etc.) in place, and develop a more intensive training programme ensuring drivers are fully aware of their responsibilities, etc.  To ensure that [1 and 2 above] are implemented as soon as practicable, the Association has contracted the Queenstown Harbourmaster to audit  all its members by 30 November 1998.",

The LTSA therefore cannot ensure that any particular action is taken by these owners.  The LTSA recognises the problems of crossings with short stacking distance.  The LTSA is not aware of signing which can be positioned to give a clear and effective warning to traffic approaching level crossings with constrained stacking distances.  However the LTSA will investigate the development of such a sign available for use at all crossings with constrained stacking distances.

This may not always secure a satisfactory outcome and specific signing of some of those crossings will be necessary.  Like any private access to a road, the responsibility for the access itself (including that relating to road safety) lies with the landowner rather than the road controlling authority.  Transit would expect the private land owner to take any initiatives for improvement such as physical works or signposting.

The LTSA may not establish safety standards unless the value of the benefits to the nation exceed the costs.  The discussion document ""Road Signs and Markings for Railway Level Crossings"" issued by the LTSA for consultation in February 1994 proposed a minimum level of treatment to be provided at any level crossing (public or private).  The consultation and evaluation failed to establish that the project could meet the reasonable cost requirement.  Regulation 124(1) of the Traffic Regulations 1976 states that every controlling authority shall erect such warning signs before a level crossing as it considers necessary to inform drivers of the level crossing and to promote safe responses from drivers approaching and crossing the level crossing.  The Traffic Regulations make no distinctions based on ownership of level crossings; obligations upon owners depend on public usage.  Regulation 124(1) applies to level crossings which are used by the public.  The 4th Schedule of the Traffic Regulations 1976 specified the signs which may be used.  The manual of Traffic Signs and Markings issued jointly by Transit New Zealand and the LTSA contain a recommended minimum treatment for level crossings used by the public, where annual average daily traffic is below 50 vehicles.

Prior to 1992 Rule 73 (n) and a mandatory requirement on Locomotive Engineers that when they were approaching public level crossings they were to sound the locomotive whistle.  The result of this was that we were continually receiving complaints in regard to noise in built up areas at night, with Plimmerton being one area where we came under particular attack to the extent that the Porirua City Council Health Department was involved by the residents concerned.  Noise readings were taken by the Council and they also employed the services of a noise pollution expert who was also working on noise nuisance created at the Wellington Airport.  One of the outcomes of the noise readings taken by the Council showed that not all our Locomotive Engineers were in fact abiding by the Companies rules and sounding the whistle.  After numerous meetings with Council it was agreed by the Company that we would change our rule to give the Locomotive Engineer more control of the use of the whistle depending on the circumstances as he saw them at the time that his train was approaching a level crossing.  As a responsible Company I do not believe that we would want to move back to a situation where we went back to creating unnecessary noise pollution by increased use of our locomotive whistles.  In other words our current rule meets the needs of safety and also the wishes of the community in regard to an acceptable level of noise pollution.",

Controllers are already adequately trained to deal with such emergencies on the basis that anything might happen and to control other aircraft, not necessarily to achieve normal separation, but, in such a way as to provide as much separation as practical and, to the extent possible, give the emergency aircraft a wide berth and as much assistance as possible.  We expect that pilots understand this principle well enough and that a controller will be better able to assist if the pilot gives as much information as possible.  If it is considered that this is not understood we believe that it is appropriate for the CAA to deliver this message to pilots through the normal channels available to them.

In situations where an emergency does not exist a pilot is required to comply with the ATC clearance or specifically request another one which is able to be complied with.  Pilots must not assume that statements related to the operating status of the aircraft or expressions of intent on their part constitute authority to depart from the terms of a clearance in non emergency situations.  This is particularly important when expressions  such as ""simulated""  are used which are not accepted standards of communications for ATS purposes.  Again CAA is the appropriate organisation to relay this warning to pilots in general.",

Airways acknowledges that the controller used the ""Roger"" response to a transmission from the pilot which was not understood by the controller.  While the investigation determined correctly that the controller did not understand the transmission it did not establish that the controller was aware at the time that any misunderstanding existed.  Our response to previous correspondence on the matter tried to make the point that it was understandable why the controller misunderstood the transmission and that the misunderstanding was unlikely to have been recognisable.  We do not think it is conceivable that a controller would use the term ""Roger"" without any further challenge if it were known that there was any misunderstanding.  We therefore don't accept the need to provide the general reminder indicated in the recommendation for circumstances in which the controller is aware of a misunderstanding.

The basic philosophy is that EICAS messages are the primary cue for accomplishing a non-normal procedure.  If a message is displayed the flight crew refers to the associated non-normal procedure.  Non-normal procedures generally address single failures.  It is not possible to develop procedures for all situations particularly those involving multiple failures.  Therefore, the IRS procedure has been written assuming a single failure.  If a second failure occurs when selecting an operable IRU, the first crew must use appropriate judgement to determine the best course of action.  It is not possible to write the non-normal procedure which correctly addresses all possible multiple failure scenarios.",

Accordingly, Boeing is currently working with the IRU supplier, Honeywell, to incorporate a software change to the ARINC output wraparound BITE test to change it from a critical to a non-critical fault and eliminate this type of discrepancy.  In addition the IRU transmitter circuit designs are being reviewed to determine if sufficient transmitter to transmitter isolation exists to tolerate a worst case external bus fault voltage that could knock out one transmitter.  We anticipate that corrective action for the IRU may be available during 1st quarter 1998.",

1995_210,015/96,MSA,1996-06-24,"That it include in the proposed Commercial White Water Rafting Code of Practice: A requirement for raft operators to show passengers an audio-visual summary of the demands of the rafting experience before they embark on the trip,...","That it include in the proposed Commercial White Water Rafting Code of Practice: A requirement for raft operators to show passengers an audio-visual summary of the demands of the rafting experience before they embark on the trip,...",,"Since my letter of 29 April 1996 when I provided you with the MSA's initial views on this proposal, we have taken the opportunity to discuss it with a Working Group elected by the rafting industry to establish a New Zealand Rafting Association.  This group, which represents a wide cross-section of operators and guides, has indicated that it is not in favour of introducing compulsory pre-trip customer viewing of a video of rafting activity.

The reasons for the group's attitude largely reflect the MSA's preliminary views which were underlined in my letter to you of 29 April 1996, and include:
â€¢  a belief that the pre-trip use of audio-visual aids would be unlikely to give clients a better perspective of the demands of the rafting experience over the information already available through brochures and other promotional material.  Many rafting clients, particularly overseas visitors, more often than not already suffer from a surfeit of audio-visual advertising trailers on white water rafting in New Zealand.  These can begin with promotional videos of New Zealand in their home country, adventure tourism video clips on the plane trip to New Zealand, similar clips run on hotel in-house TV channels, and finish with advertising videos playing continuously in a number of rafting companies' booking offices.  In many cases, the scenes depicted are dramatic and include clients being thrown out of rafts but, not surprisingly from a marketing perspective, still project an image of fun/enjoyment.
â€¢  In Queenstown, where the most serious rafting accidents have occurred in recent years, I believe that most, if not all, operators have videos running continuously in their booking offices.  In the event that a new audio-visual safety video was to be introduced, it would be difficult to package the information in a way that is sufficiently different from what they perceive to be great fun and relatively safe.  Indeed, part of the problem which operators face is that clients often ""don't want to know"".  This was borne out by members of the Working Group and an MSA survey of rafting company clients carried out in 1995.  Indeed, the client survey concluded the ""people's reviews of these factors (advertising brochures, statistics, company shop displays etc.) were firmly oriented to the positives, and any negative information was typically rationalised and diminished in value"".
â€¢  Practical difficulties associated with the video proposal.  For example, it would be difficult to get all clients to view a video presentation.  While it would not be a problem to get clients leaving for the river from a booking office to turn up a bit earlier for an audio-visual presentation, it would be much more difficult to catch those who have booked their trip by phone (either directly, or through a hotel or agent) and arrange to turn up at the riverside ready to raft.  Their means of transport could be private car, helicopter or jet boat depending on the particular package they have booked.  This phone/fax style of booking rafting trips is becoming more prevalent with on-line computer booking etc.
â€¢  It would impose additional costs on the industry for no apparent significant benefit.  Apart from the direct costs to operators for providing the video, there could be indirect costs if, for example, the additional time involved reduced the number of trips that an operator could run during the day.

The Group agreed that there is an issue of how to make rafting company clients more aware of the demands and risks associated with river rafting so that they may make a more informed decision on whether to raft or not and, having made a decision to proceed, be better able to respond to the demands that are placed upon them during the trip.  However, they believe that this is better addressed by other safety requirements included in the draft Code of Practice which focus on direct verbal and physical safety instruction/demonstration both on and off the water.  This would include the safety card proposal put forward by TAIC (recommendation 020/96) which is discussed below.  An improvement in the opportunities for clients to opt out of the trip which are provided for under the draft code will also help.  In conclusion, taking into account the rafting industry's comments and our own assessment of TAIC's recommendations, the MSA has decided to ... reject recommendation 015/96 concerning the mandatory use of audio-visual presentations.",

The Company considers it significant that while the Manufacturers Manual is silent on the issue of non-precision approaches, in general, the manufacturer's recommendation in relation to precision approaches is that the flaps are extended to approach setting before guide slope capture, i.e. descent.  (See Flight Manual section 4/3/7).

The practice of early configuration is intended to enhance rather than compromise safety of the flight during the landing approach phase, and the procedure does not prevent the GPWS from providing effective warning.  The early configuration procedure appears common to a number of airlines, indeed to all airlines both in New Zealand and overseas that Ansett New Zealand has contacted regarding this matter.

It would therefore appear, that Ansett New Zealand's policy and procedure of aircraft configuration reflects ""mainstream"" aviation practice and is not a procedure or practice unique to the Company.  Accordingly, before the Company takes any further steps in relation to this practice and/or departs from the practice, Ansett New Zealand proposes to further study and review the practice with a view to assessing whether the advantages of positive flight safety resulting from the practice outweigh any safety disadvantage.

In short, Ansett New Zealand has adopted the recommendation by reviewing the Company's procedure, but to date no change to the Company's procedure has been initiated.",

1.  The current availability of off-the-shelf equipment which could be added on the AIRCAT 2000 to give minimum safe altitude warning alerts to ATC.
2.  The cost of such equipment.
3.  Specific details as to what warnings can be given and how they are triggered.
4.  Details on what if any systems of this type are currently being used by other ATC service providers and their effectiveness.
5.   Whether any currently available equipment, if it had been operational in the accident area, could have avoided the accident involving ZK-NEY.
6.  What if any enhancements would need to be made to currently available equipment in order that it could have been used to avoid the accident.
7.  The cost of any such enhancements.
8.  Airways' legal liability exposure resulting from the use of such a system.
9.  The New Zealand aviation industry's desire for Airways to be involved in the provision of a minimum safe altitude warning service.

This investigation has already begun with work having been completed on the first two items.  We consider that it would be reasonable to expect that the investigation should be completed by 31 December 1996.  It should be noted that this investigation will aim to determine the practicality of developing and incorporating a suitable facility into Airways' systems but any implementation would be entirely dependent on the findings of the investigation.",

Differences in terminology have been discussed with Bombardier, and Ansett New Zealand understands that Bombardier will initiate editorial changes in due course.  The terminology used to describe aircraft equipment is properly a matter for the manufacturer and not the responsibility of the aircraft operator.  Accordingly, Ansett New Zealand has adopted and implemented this recommendation as far as it is able to do so, but those aspects which are within the province of the aircraft manufacturer remain the manufacturer's responsibility.  Ansett New Zealand suggests that a Safety Recommendation directed to the manufacturer regarding terminology would be appropriate.

Accordingly this safety recommendation has been adopted and implemented by Ansett New Zealand.",
1995_011,109/95,Ansett NZ,1996-04-29,"Review Ansett's practice of setting MDA once established on the approach, with a view to implementing a procedure which will not set the MDA before it is safe to descend to that altitude.","Review Ansett's practice of setting MDA once established on the approach, with a view to implementing a procedure which will not set the MDA before it is safe to descend to that altitude.",,"Ansett New Zealand has reviewed the practice of setting MDA (in the ALT SEL) and has concluded that the practice is indeed appropriate.

Given that the ALT SEL cannot be ""disconnected"" from the Auto Flight Guidance System, it is consequently always ""live"", and as a result will warn of deviation from, or approach to any set altitude.  The system is designed to provide a protection in respect of cleared altitude.

Setting the ALT SEL to any other altitude than MDA (i.e. missed approach altitudes, commencement altitude, or any intermediate altitude within 1,000 feet of setting), would result in continuous warnings that would have to be ignored by the flight crew.  Ansett New Zealand considers that any practice which has that effect is itself patently unsafe.

The setting of MDA provides a real warning when approaching MDA, and Ansett New Zealand notes that such a warning would have occurred on the accident flight.

It is noted that during a precision approach the system is automatically disabled to preclude inappropriate warnings.

Further the ALT SEL plays no part in the instrument scan, and neither should it.  The system is set to provide a warning approaching the cleared altitude, in this case the MDA.

Instrument approach profiles are not flown by reference to ALT SEL, and neither is MDA referenced from the ALT SEL, in this or in any other airline of which Ansett New Zealand is aware.  MDA is referenced by the altimeter and the safe achievement of any MDA, on any kind of approach requires adherence to the published profile for that approach.

Therefore, following its review of the practice (as recommended by this safety recommendation), Ansett New Zealand concluded that to the extent that the recommendation suggests the implementation of a procedure which would not involve the setting of MDA ""before it is safe to descend to that altitude"" that such suggested procedure would in practice be detrimental to flight safety, with the result that Ansett New Zealand having reviewed the matter, has concluded that it will not adopt any recommendation to implement such a procedure.",

The characteristics of the systems installed on both aircraft types operated by Ansett New Zealand, are such that the potential hazards of that practise may well outweigh any workload benefit.

In respect of the Dash-8 aircraft, the Auto Flight Control System (AFCS) which incorporates the Autopilot, is only approved for use on CAT 1 Precision Approaches.

Additionally, the Manufacturer's limitations provide for a minimum height for Autopilot use of 1,000 feet AGL, precluding use on approaches where this limitation is likely to be infringed.

Accordingly the use of Autopilots and to a lesser extent Flight Directors, is not considered by Ansett New Zealand to be presently practicable; however, before reaching a final decision on the matter, the Company proposes to continue its investigation and review and to seek advice from both the Manufacturer and other operators.

3. The contractual provision is not inconsistent with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) requirements of member states.

4. The contractual provision relates specifically to the implementation of paragraph 5.12 of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention 1944 in particular and to the implementation of Annex 13 in general.

5. The contractual provision has not operated to prevent the presence of CVRs on Ansett New Zealand Aircraft.

6. Annex 13 has not been embodied in New Zealand legislation, and this failure is not consistent with the obligations of the New Zealand government under Article 37 of the Convention.

7. New Zealand's non-conformance with its international obligations in this regard is demonstrably out of step with the legislative developments in countries of similar status such as Australia, Canada, the USA and the United Kingdom.

9. NZALPA is only one of over 120 parties to the Ansett New Zealand Limited pilots' contract.

The inherent difficulties of achieving effective LOFT training, where a simulator cannot be employed, is not a problem unique to Ansett New Zealand.  The Company agrees, that CRM training can obviously be made more effective by the use of a Simulator, however in circumstances where a simulator was not available, Ansett New Zealand made a significant effort to introduce all practicable realism for Dash 8 crew in this phase of their training.

Accordingly, Ansett New Zealand has explored and is in fact now negotiating for the use of a Dash 8 Flight Simulator in its training programme, and as such, adopts this recommendation.

However, even from the submissions B.A.N.Z. received on the issue, the consensus of common-sense prevailed whereby B.A.N.Z. believed this important consideration is best served by an education process rather than a legislative one amongst its members.  Indeed there is currently no provision within the rules of B.A.N.Z. to form such policy or rule-making pertaining to the specific conditions of flight or operation of balloons.  The constitution of B.A.N.Z. is rather a more open statement of general objectivity.

Furthermore it is not compulsory for all balloon pilots/operators to be members of B.A.N.Z., therefore B.A.N.Z. has no clear mandate to direct compliance to such balloonists who are not B.A.N.Z. members although having said that I expect such compliance could be facilitated by Reg. 19B 3 .

However as a responsible organisation with the objective of encouraging and promoting hot air ballooning in New Zealand B.A.N.Z. is at liberty to endorse your commissions findings in general.  This can, at best, be achieved by stating recommendations, based on common sense, to all its members and clubs etc. by way of B.A.N.Z. newsletters and meetings rather than by the process of formal rule making per se(.  I believe it is not the intent of the B.A.N.Z. constitution to be making its first of what would be many to follow formal rules of this nature.

Therefore informing you of B.A.N.Z.'s position in not currently proceeding with the formal making of rules (for Safety Recommendation No. 006/96) I expect final consideration of this position to be discussed and decided upon at the next B.A.N.Z. annual general meeting.",

The issue of whether the GPWS installed in the accident aircraft performed its intended function appropriately is a serious concern to Transport Canada.  We are therefore prepared, in conjunction with the aircraft manufacturer, to initiate a review of the certification of GPWS installation in the DHC 8 aircraft.  If any area of uncertainty in the certification is identified, you can be assured that Transport Canada will take appropriate action.

Wider accident investigation related issues of GPWS performance in prevention of CFIT accidents in the particular environment and terrain of the accident site would be logistically impractical and outside the scope of the Transport Canada certification review.

Currently, Transport Canada has limited knowledge of the accident and therefore, the Transport Accident Investigation Commission should anticipate future requests for technical information related to the accident.",

Given the SITO concern at the financial implications of this recommendation MSA may suggest implementing an abridged fire fighting course.  The implementation of Chapter III Regulation 1 'Basic Safety Training for all Fishing Vessel Personnel' in the proposed Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Fishing Personnel 1995 Convention (STCW-F) will also be discussed.  Qualifications are also at this time being 'packaged' into the Unit Standards of learning required.

The other is a five day course designed for holders to take charge of survival craft.  This course is modelled on the International Maritime Organisation course and meets the international requirements.  MSA doesn't feel it appropriate or necessary that QFDH's be required to hold the full qualification but a complete syllabus review for use under the Maritime Units of Learning is planned for this year and the two day course will be fully considered.

(b) The Airworthiness Directive, attached, is mandatory and effective immediately on receipt. (c) The reason for not adopting Recommendation 096/95 in the terms framed by TAIC is that Robinson R22 helicopters are granted New Zealand Certificates of Airworthiness based on the acceptance of the Type Certificate issued by the certificating authority in the country of design and manufacture i.e. The Federal Aviation Administration in the USA.

The initiating cause to which this accident has been attributed has been identified as de-bonding of a tail rotor blade in flight.  This is not seen as being an appropriate reason for the validity of Certificates of Airworthiness, issued for Robinson R22 helicopters currently included in the New Zealand aircraft register, to be reviewed.

However, on 2 November 1995 all Robinson R22 helicopter owners were notified of the relevant accident findings up to that date and were recommended to accomplish close visual inspection of all installed tail rotor blades.  A copy of this notice was also sent to TAIC.  Owners were requested to immediately notify CAA of any defects found.  No reports have so far been received.

Further action has today been initiated, when more information concerning the origin of the failed blade became available from the manufacturer. (See DCA/R22/29).",

Subsequent to this, high intensity ""railway crossing"" signs (PW14) were erected on 10 January 1995.

Changes to be Implemented.

I have approved the following to enhance the railway level crossing conspicuity.
â€¢  review with NZ Rail the alignment of the flashing lights and adjust as necessary.
â€¢  install red backing boards to the ""Railway Crossing"" signs (PW-14) and adjust position of the northbound direction to maximise driver awareness; and
â€¢  paint the message ""Rail X"" on the road on either side of the crossing point, again ensuring adequate prior warning for drivers.

It is expected that this work will be completed by the end of August 1995.

Other points raised in your recommendation have been carefully considered and it is my intention to take up with the Land Transport Safety Authority progress on finalising the proposed ""Code for Road Signs and Markings for Railway Level Crossings"".  I am reluctant to introduce changes relating to this new code on a one off basis as this may prove confusing for drivers who are only familiar with current practice.

Section 7, Clause 6.8 stated (in part)

6.8.1  Basic Running Time
A basic running time refers to a specific section of track, locomotive, train weight and train type.  For any given set of conditions, the basis running time may be defined as the least time the specified weight of train could run through the particular section of track, the speed being kept at tall times as close of possible to the authorised speeds, up to the performance capacity of the locomotive.

6.8.1.1  These are based on:
â€¢  Normal operating conditions.
â€¢  Normal condition of locomotives and rolling stock, e.g.  for locomotive performance and train resistance.
â€¢  Authorised speeds as defined in the Working Timetable for the locomotive and train concerned, including permanent speed restrictions.

â€¢  Curve speeds as authorised by General Manager, Engineering in consultation with General Manager, Network Operations.

6.8.1.2   A basic running time does not include any allowance for:
â€¢  Starting and stopping at the beginning and end of the specified sections.
â€¢  Temporary speed restrictions or deceleration and acceleration in connection therewith.
â€¢  Standing time at intermediate stops for crossings, crew changes etc.
â€¢  Abnormal weather.
â€¢  Condition of locomotive or rolling stock.
â€¢  Contingencies or make-up time.

It must be emphasised that the basic running time is not necessarily the least time a train of specified type and locomotive can run through the section without exceeding authorised speeds.

In relation to your particular proposal, TNZ has consulted with the Hutt and Wellington City Councils about pedestrian/cyclist facilities on State Highway 2 and priorities for them.

Three issues have been identified which will require examination.  They are:
â€¢  The lack of connection between your proposed footway and pedestrian facilities at the other end;
â€¢  The preference of cyclists to use the road shoulder; and
â€¢  The low priority given to this work by the cities in comparison to their other cycle/pedestrian projects. 

The suggestion that a walkway/ cycleway between the road and rail was eliminated by widening the highway is not correct.  The traffic lane has always been part of the on-ramp at the Petone over bridge.  The on-ramp merging lane was however extended, with the agreement of the Hutt City Council, to solve a traffic conflict issue.  There was concern about the number of vehicle accidents, and it was throughout that very few pedestrians would consider walking on the State Highway 2 verge.  Transit New Zealand recently looked at the feasibility of bringing southbound cyclists and perhaps pedestrians from State Highway 2 under the over bridge beside the rail tracks.  However, following discussion with New Zealand Rail Ltd, it was decided that there was insufficient room to do so safely.  It seems that there are no simple solutions to corrections at Petone.",

This is an important safeguard which will help ensure that pilots have sufficient confidence in the Association's system that they will entrust documents to it.  Coincidentally, the CAA has been looking at other good reasons for appointing a medical adviser.  These include the Association taking responsibility for achieving reasonable uniformity of medical standards.  At present, doctors turn to the CAA's PMO to discuss doubtful cases, but uniformity would be aided by having a separate medical adviser.  There is also a need to avoid unduly rigorous medical forms and procedures (a problem which has been noted in the related area of gliding medical certificates).  When working in isolation, the various associations may tend to be unaware of relaxation in the field of CAA Medical Certificates and inertia may result in standards more strict than for a PPL.

It is intended in future that the medical advisers of the various associations will keep in closer touch with the CAA's Principal Medical Officer, in order to share knowledge.  The appointment of a medical adviser has therefore been made a requirement of the approval of the Association's operations manual.",

Since public exposure to these risks is minimal, it is CAA policy to avoid undue restriction on microlight activity.

It is important for CAA to monitor microlight incidents and accidents for indications of safety trends.  This monitoring is hindered by a probable under-reporting of incidents, and the accident in question is of concern to CAA in its implication that the present system of medical certification also hindered investigation.  It is possible that the case involved the passenger (who was killed) believing that the pilot was medically fit to fly.  There is limited evidence that this was not correct (or at least that the pilot might have been better to have been restricted to not carrying passengers).

It is important, even in such a high risk activity, for participants not to have misplaced confidence in a system of medical certification.  One option would be to disband the present system, and have no medical certifications.  This option is not favoured by the CAA.

The alternative would seem to be to insist that the Association develop a more credible system of medical  certification.  While the CAA supports this option, it does not favour the exact detail of recommendation 060/92, which sounds a little paternalistic.  Pilots licensed by CAA are responsible for holding their own CAA Medical Certificate.  It seems appropriate that a microlight pilot, rather than the Association, should hold the equivalent certificate.  The CAA recommends that the Association as the 'licensing' body should consider establishing a centralised database.  Individual clubs could hold copies (not originals) of certificates, notifying the central association of updated information.  When pilots transfer to another club, an appropriate transfer of documents should occur (as noted in your letter of 24 December 1992).  Pilots not flying via a club, should provide the central register with the updated information and should be identifiable on the database as having this independent status.

The database should hold basic identifying information of each pilot.  In the case of the medical certificate, essential details to be recorded would be date issued, name and address of issuing doctor, whether the doctor is the pilots general practitioner or is a CAA-appointed medical examiner, and details of any restrictions recommended by the doctor.  There should be an indication of whether the Association holds more detailed records elsewhere.  It would permit the Association to set up some quality controls central, to ensure that documents are being issued to a standard appropriate to the activity.  Such standards should be incorporated in the Association's operations manual.",

As a result of that research, and the ensuing NPRMs (which have included proposed rules very similar to the TAIC suggestion, but which have not been adopted) and associated comments from industry, the FAA regulatory situation in 1993 relating to FAR 23 size aircraft is as follows:

FAR 23.3(a)  requires all normal utility and acrobatic aircraft, (i.e. aircraft with a passenger seating configuration, excluding pilots, of nine or less), manufactured after 12 December 1986 for entry into the United States to provide a safety belt and should harness for each forward or aft-facing seat.

FAR 23.785(g) requires all aircraft (type certificated since July 18 1978) to provide a safety belt and shoulder harness for each front seat (and to meet certain other related safety considerations).

FAR 91.205(b) (13) requires all small civil aeroplanes manufactured after July 18 1978 to provide an approved shoulder harness for each front seat.

The first two rules also apply in New Zealand as FAR 23 is the basic airworthiness standard in New Zealand for light aircraft.  However, neither of these rules have had much effect in practice, as few if any aircraft have been certificated since 1978, nor have many aircraft been manufactured since 1986 by the moribund US general aviation industry.

The third rule would have the greatest practical effect but is an operating rule applicable in the US only and for which at present there is no equivalent in New Zealand.  However, as most light aircraft have been built either in the US or destined for the US market, it is not likely aircraft destined for New Zealand would be built to a different standard and any light aircraft in New Zealand manufactured after 18 July 1978 should have shoulder harnesses fitted to the front seats.

As the retrospective fitting of shoulder harnesses to all seats of all existing light aircraft has not yet been made a rule in the US or elsewhere, the Authority does not believe there is sufficient justification to consider making such a rule in New Zealand, which apart from imposing a considerable financial and technical burden on the industry would place it out of step with other airworthiness authorities when the world-wide trend is towards harmonisation of such airworthiness regulations.

It is believed the FAA is continuing studies in the area, and in particular looking at extending the existing FAR 91 requirements to include all seats.  If such a rule was adopted by the FAA the Authority would then look seriously at including such a requirement in New Zealand, possibly in the new CAR Part 91 still to be developed.",

There is no requirement for the State to comply with any ICAO standards with respect to deer recovery as it does not involve any international air Navigation and therefore the State is free to set its own regulations or Requirements.

The standard seat restraint that is utilised in the majority of helicopters is designed and constructed to internationally acceptable standards and works extremely well for the purpose for which it was actually designed.  It was however not designed to be used for purpose of restraining deer shooters.

The issue here, it to establish what role the State has to plan the setting and application of standards relating to personal restrain systems for helicopter borne deer shooters.  The recommendations of the report indicate that the State should take an active in-depth role in establishing what should be an appropriate restraint system to provide an appropriate degree of shooter safety during hunting operations, although it does not go on to suggest what an appropriate degree of safety actually is.  The previous role of the State regulatory agency was paternal in nature and tended to regulate civil aviation activity in a manner that has since been recognised as over regulatory.  Swedavia state ""if individuals wish to fly and will not endanger the lives and property of others, they should be free to do so.""

We all accept that shooting deer from a helicopter is an activity that presents an extreme risk to both the shooter and the pilot of the helicopter.  There have been a multitude of accidents and incidents as a direct result of the high risk involved in deer recovery since the start of this activity in the early seventies.  it is probably correct to say that incidents relating to the inadvertent uncoupling of passenger restraints are amongst the minority of incidents that have taken place.

Helicopter borne deer shooters are well aware of the risks that they undertake and are driven by the instinct of self preservation terms of the way they approach their tasks and in what they choose to wear as protective clothing and airborne restraint system, they are also there out of individual choice and, by the very nature of the activity being conducted in remote locations, they do not endanger the lives and property of others.

Regulating, through a consultative process, a standard for a deer shooter restraint system is typical of the paternal approach that was applied by the CAD prior to Swedavia.  The CA Act 1990 clearly places the responsibility for safety operation upon any person undertaking aviation activities and there is sufficient equipment and information available today for deer shooters to establish appropriate safety restraint devices without requiring the State to undertake this research on their behalf.

Conclusion:
â€¢  The State does not have a responsibility or policy to regulate as recommended.
â€¢  Helicopter borne deer shooting does not present a danger to persons or property other than those undertaking the activity itself.

Mini Seminar:  A group of 16 pilots took part in a discussion on formation flying held at Ashburton on 4 July.  Basis for the discussion was the article in the June 1992 ""Flight Safety"" magazine.  The author, Mrs Pam Collings, was present and the discussion proved to be a valuable exercise.  Many of those present were experienced formation pilots.

With the information already to hand (which has been effectively collated in the Flight Safety article) the RNZAC plans to produce instructional material for the information of its members and any others who might find it useful.

It is hoped that a training course for instructors will be run at CFS, RNZAF Base Wigram, at some time during the year.  Formation flying will be a major focus.

I am sure these steps as outlined above will prove to be a useful addition to the pursuit of flight safety which is to the fore in the aims of the RNZAC and its members.",

This is a significant amendment to present procedures applicable where an aircraft wishes to cross the path of another aircraft on final approach.  This procedure, the instructions given to pilots would be more specific than was the case in the incident in April last year, rendering a repeat of that incident unlikely.  However, pilot action and judgement will always be a factor.

TAIC's recommendation will not be applied where the aircraft concerned are both in the circuit.  The application of TAIC's recommendation in that situation would render the control of traffic in aerodrome circuits almost impossible.

At PPL level, 50 hours are required for a full licence, for both aeroplanes and helicopters.

However, for CPL, an aeroplane pilot requires either 150 or 200 hours depending upon training.  A helicopter pilot requires 125 or 150.  A glider pilot requires 150 hours.  A balloon pilot requires 50 hours.

For ATPL, an aeroplane pilot requires 1500 hours, while a helicopter pilot requires 1000 hours.

The breakdown of these totals into dual, solo and pilot in command also varies between different aircraft categories.  There are also differences in the cross-crediting allowances between the different aircraft categories.

The differences are in accordance with ICAO Annex 1 requirements.  The 35 hour pilot-in-command for the CPL-H referred to in your recommendation is the Annex 1 requirement. 

Helicopter pilots justify the lesser hours they require on the basis that helicopter flying is more exacting and every hour flown is therefore more meaningful.  Flight time logged is all air time without associated taxiing time.

The question of flight time requirements is complex and the decision had already been taken to refer the helicopter requirements to the HURDA process for a full analysis.

Meanwhile the solo flight time requirement for PPL-H has been increased from 10 hours to 15 hours in the new Part 61 AC.  This is in full accordance with your recommendation.",

1989_064,046/91,ATD MoT,1991-07-24,Align the requirement for the fitting of Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) with the ICAO recommendation on this topic.,Align the requirement for the fitting of Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) with the ICAO recommendation on this topic.,,"Amendment 13 of 13.4.79 to ICAO 6 introduced a standard which required all turbine engine aeroplanes with a take-off weight in excess of 15,000 kg or authorised to carry more than 30 passengers to be equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System.  The standard is applicable to aeroplanes for which the individual C of A was first issued on or after 1.7.79.  The amendment also recommended the requirement be applied regardless of the issue date of the individual C of A.

The recommendation was adopted by New Zealand in 1984 by AD/GEN/13 with an effective date of 31.12.85, after it was generally accepted the early problems with false warnings had been largely overcome.  After representations by Safe Air on cost benefit grounds for the Argosy aircraft the AD allowed concessions to be permitted for existing aircraft ""used entirely or mainly for freight operations within New Zealand"".

Subsequently it was amended as AD/GEN/13A on 1.8.86 changing the applicability to turbo jet aircraft, thus excluding turbo prop aircraft, because of the problems of nuisance warnings.  (The fact that GPWS is not very effective for turbo prop aircraft, due to their lower speeds requiring a larger closure gradient to activate a GPWS warning, this was pointed out at the time of the original AD).  In the US, GPWS requirements were applied to all large aircraft operating under Part 121, but only to large turbo jet aircraft when operating under Para 135, as in New Zealand.

However, in April 1990 the FAA issued an NPRM proposing to extend the requirement to all large turbine powered aircraft operating under Part 135 because there had been quite a number of controlled flight into terrain accidents to turbo prop aircraft which could have been prevented had GPWS been fitted to the aircraft.  It was also noted the cost of suitable equipment for smaller turbo propeller aircraft has fallen significantly in recent years.  However, to date, no final ruling has been received on this proposal.

In the accident to ZK-FTB the MODE 3 Descent After Takeoff envelope would have been penetrated and a ""Don't sink"" warning due to an altitude loss of more than 10% below 700 ft AGL should have been given.  Thus the accident may have been preventable if GPWS was fitted.

TAIC should be advised that ATD is awaiting the outcome of the FAA rule on this issue and will be reviewing the subject in general to determine if circumstances have changed at all since the revision of the AD.",

Instruments identified by the designator 'GenINST' shall be tested at 2 yearly intervals when installed in IFR aircraft.  'GyroINST' instruments shall be removed from the aircraft and tested or repaired as necessary also every two years for IFR Air Transport aircraft, or 'whenever a defect is suspected or observed'.  In addition, Group 1 Instruments held in store shall be subject to tests at periods recommended by the manufacturer or at periods not exceeding 2 years from the date of manufacturer or last overhaul.  (Except instruments which have been inhibited and stored in hermetically sealed containers need not be re-tested).  The Fieldair Freight Maintenance Programme for the CV580 required an avionics inspection to be carried out at every periodic inspection, which occurred ever 100 flying hours.

Thus the recommendation is effectively already embodied in the Regulations which require regular tests for both stored instruments and those fitted on aircraft.  The recommendation does not appear to have any foundation or relevance to the accident since it is acknowledged the ADI defect was known by the company and had been entered in the maintenance log 'Deferred for parts'.

In the rewrite of the New Zealand rules, presently under way based on the FARs, it is intended to abolish the fixed removal and check periods currently in NZCAR Section F9 and replace them with 'On Condition' maintenance for all aircraft in conjunction with compliance with manufacturers recommendations.  It has been found in practice this is a more cost effective system since removing a fully functioning instrument can often create problems, rather than lessening them.",

This would give flexibility while allowing aircraft to fly to MacKinnon Pass and return to overhead Milford Sound without encountering dense traffic.,,"Had no action been taken since the accident on 30 December 1989 there would be merit in considering this recommendation.  However, this is not the case.  On Thursday, 4 January 1990 a meeting was held in the Lakeland Hotel, Queenstown, between the aircraft operators and the Air Transport Division.  The question was put to the operators:  ""Do you, the operators have a problem in the Queenstown-Milford Sound area?""  The operators identified the lack of parking and a taxiway on the ground at Milford for runway 29 as the main reasons for the congestion that developed in the air.  Radio procedures and reported points were discussed in detail.  The means by which pilots qualified for a Milford rating was debated at length.  Following all of this it was agreed that an Association be formed.  The Chief Pilot, or his nominee, from each company would form the membership of the Association.  Don Spary would be the official spokesman and the ATD would be the facilitator.

Since that first meeting there has been additional meetings.  A position reporting and collision avoidance system has been put in place (see Class II NOTAM in the AIP New Zealand Flight Guide (see page 5-25, para 14.7 - Milford Sound).

The parking area at Milford Sound has been enlarged and sealed and a taxiway to runway 29 has been constructed.  This has lead to an orderly flow of traffic on departure from Milford Sound and has eliminated the bunching of aircraft at the take-off point.

The operators have put in place arrival and departure procedures that provide vertical and horizontal separation between aircraft arriving at Milford and aircraft departing.  In addition there is also a longitudinal separation imposed on the departing traffic.

Following the introduction of these procedures a senior inspector has carried out surveillance checks and the  operators have been subject to audit by the ATD.

The Association of operators and the ATD have drafted and agreed on the criterion for a Milford Sound aerodrome approval.  This will be issued in a CAIC-GEN and will also be incorporated in the Flight Guide together with the reporting points.

1990_049,039/90,NZ Gliding Assn.,1990-10-16,Consider introducing a procedure whereby the ground-crew check with the pilot that a glider's airbrakes are locked prior to attaching the cable.,Consider introducing a procedure whereby the ground-crew check with the pilot that a glider's airbrakes are locked prior to attaching the cable.,,"The accident sequence could have been broken at a number of points.  However, modern, high aspect ratio gliders, capable of carrying large volumes of water ballast, are susceptible to dropping a wing during the initial part of the ground roll.  This in turn leads to ground loops which may, themselves, result in damage to the glider.

The reason for the wing drop is a combination of the low speed achieved by the wing runner and the relative ineffectiveness of the ailerons at that low speed.

Overseas it has been found that starting the take off run with the airbrakes EXTENDED assists in wing control during the initial stage of the take-off run.  This appears to be because only the outer part of the wing is producing lift and this means that the aileron is producing, proportionately, more lift.  The brakes are closed as the aircraft gains flying speed. 

This method is effective in preventing wing drop.

Because this is an effective measure we cannot condone a procedure that required the ground-crew to require the airbrakes to be locked before the attachment of the tow rope.  However; we do note the pilot's intention to use this control during the launch should have been briefed to the ground-crew and the tow pilot.",

The type of helicopter involved in this accident was Certificated to FAR Part 27, which applies to Normal Category Rotorcraft with a maximum weight less than 6000lbs.  Section 27.807 requires each emergency exit to; ""(2) Be readily accessible ... and be located so as to allow ready use ... in any probable attitudes that may result from a crash""; and to ""(3) Have a simple and obvious method of opening and be arranged and marked so as to be readily located and operated, even in darkness.""

In addition, New Zealand Civil Aviation Regulation 75, ""Marking of Exits"", requires that; ""The operating instructions for exits and emergency exits shall be clearly visible and legible both by day and by night"".

This is amplified in NZCAR Section C.4, ""Design Requirements"", paragraph 8.7, ""Marking of doors and emergency exits"", which states that ""The means of access and method of opening of all such exits shall be conspicuously marked on both the inside and outside of the exits, or an adjacent surface"", and ""All essential internal or external instructions for operation of the exits shall be concise and shall be in easily readable letters on a contrasting background"".
