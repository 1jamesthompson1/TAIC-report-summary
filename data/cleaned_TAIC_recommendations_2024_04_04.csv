There were indicators from previous audits that not all policies and procedures were being followed as intended by the operator. This, in combination with the non-adherence to other aspects of the policies and procedures leading up to this grounding, is an indication that the procedural failures may not have been confined to this one accident, and that the operator will need to review the standard of navigation under pilotage for all its crews to ensure that industry good practice is being followed.

On 26 June 2019, "
95,2018_203,006/19,the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive Officer of Port Otago that they note where this report identifies areas where pilotage operations can be improved and continue taking the necessary actions to ensure that pilotage operations fully meet good industry practice and the guidance provided in the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code.,"At the time of the grounding, Port Otagoâ€™s policies, procedures and compliance monitoring of pilotage operations fell short of meeting good industry standards for pilot training outlined in maritime rules, or fully achieving the principles of safety management systems outlined in the New Zealand Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code._x000D_
_x000D_
On 26 June 2019, "
96,2015_007,002/19,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation initiate an independent review of CAA surveillance reports and any findings raised for Part 135 operators since 2014 to measure the effectiveness of the surveillance policies and procedures that the CAA has put in place, including the effectiveness of their implementation. If the independent review finds unidentified or unresolved safety issues with specific operators, it is recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation take the appropriate urgent action to resolve those issues.","The CAA said that it had put in place changes in policy and training for its inspectors by February 2014. Leading up to that date, and afterwards, CAA inspectors had overlooked significant non-compliances by the operator of the helicopter at Fox Glacier and they had not raised findings on matters of non-compliance with Civil Aviation rules.

In this case the CAA had had good cause and ample opportunities to intervene at an early stage. Instead the operator was allowed to continue, with little change to improve its systems. Those systems put the pilot in a position of responsibility that the pilot was not sufficiently trained or experienced for.

The Commission is concerned that there could be a wider safety issue whereby other Part 135 operators that were in the civil aviation system during the same period could have significant non-compliances that have either not been identified or not been resolved.

On 21 February 2019 "
97,2017_104,001/19,"the Commission recommended that Transdev Auckland improve the quality of training for train crews, including training on liaising with emergency services, so that they are better prepared to respond to unusual situations.","The training that the train crew had received was limited to conflict avoidance and did not provide them with the skills to deal with wider security scenarios.

The action the train crew took on this occasion was appropriate. However, the crew was not trained in alternative options. In different circumstances the crew might need to take alternative action. Guidance on the options that might suit various scenarios would be useful to train crews.

On 21 February 2019 "
98,2017_204,004/19,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of Maritime New Zealand promulgate, through the Secretariat of the Port and Harbour Marine Safety Code Steering Group, the findings of this report, in particular the potential dangers associated with securing vessels that may be capable of generating loads in excess of those that the port infrastructure can withstand. Port companies should have a thorough appreciation of the loads involved for various ship types as well as the load limitations of the port infrastructure.","The port company should ensure that a berth allocated to a visiting vessel is suitable. A prerequisite for achieving that is port companies having an understanding of the loads capable of being generated by vessels with large windage areas and whether the port infrastructure is capable of withstanding them.

On 21 February 2019 "
99,2017_204,003/19,"the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of PrimePort Timaru that, until all the planned improvement work is completed, a ship-to-berth risk assessment be undertaken for all vessels intending to use the port. The assessment should identify whether a berth is safe for a vessel to remain alongside, define any operational limits or restrictions and identify any additional control measures that may be required. This information should be passed to the ship prior to arrival.","The responsibility for the safety and security of a vessel moored alongside a harbour wharf lies with both the vessel and the port operator. Notwithstanding that joint responsibility it remains an important function of a port to ensure that the wharf structure and mooring system is adequate for any vessel that intends to use it.

Section 7 of this report draws attention to the work that PrimePort Timaru is currently undertaking, and the work it is planning to undertake, to improve the condition and reliability of its wharves, associated mooring systems and mooring procedures.

Until all of the improvement work has been completed, it is important that the port ensures that the infrastructure and procedures in place at any given time are suitable for any vessel intending to use the port.

On 21 February 2019 "
100,2017_105,031/18,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take the necessary action to clarify the allocation of responsibilities between licensed rail access providers and road controlling authorities for maintaining sighting distances at public road level crossings.,"The sighting distance for road users at the Lambert Road level crossing did not meet the minimum standard as set out in the Manual. It was possible that drivers who did stop at the stop sign would not have had sufficient time to clear the level crossing if a train was just out of view.

Maintaining sighting distances at level crossings is critical for the safety of road users. While most of the factors that are considered when deciding on the level of protection to give a level crossing are unlikely to change significantly over time, vegetation growth can relatively quickly render a level crossing unsafe.

The legislation is not clear on the allocation of responsibility between rail access providers and road controlling authorities for ensuring the safety of rail and road users at public road level crossings.

104,2017_203,030/18,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand raise through the appropriate International Maritime Organization safety committee for its consideration, the implications for maritime safety of not having adequate minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure vessels that are part of a stored energy system.","The cylinder failed at below its normal working pressure because severe external corrosion had reduced the wall thickness from 4.81 mm to 1.45 mm (about 30% of its original thickness).

The failed nitrogen cylinder and several other pressure cylinders within the stored energy system were not fit for purpose and should not have been in service.

There is an urgent need for consistent and proper standards to be developed at a global level for maintaining, inspecting, testing and, where necessary, replacing high-pressure cylinders associated with stored energy systems on board ships.

Under the applicable IMO requirements, the stored energy systems were to be examined annually for â€œsatisfactory condition and operationâ€; however, the IMO did not provide any recommended minimum standards for the inspection, testing and rejection of pressure vessels that were part of a stored energy system. This resulted in different flag states having different minimum requirements for ensuring that pressure vessels remained in â€˜satisfactory conditionâ€™. Some flag states had no minimum testing and rejection requirements for pressure vessels associated with stored energy systems.

On 22 November 2018 "
105,2017_203,029/18,the Commission recommended that the manufacturer carry out a review of its current training processes and ensure that inspections of stored energy systems are carried out by technicians who are trained and certified to inspect them.,"The nitrogen cylinders that formed part of the stored energy system on board the Emerald Princess were stowed in a harsh marine environment and had significant external corrosion.

The nitrogen cylinders were inspected annually by the manufacturerâ€™s authorised technician. The most recent inspection was two weeks prior to the accident. On each occasion the cylinders were judged to be in satisfactory working condition.

The circumstances of this accident raise the question of whether the current training requirements for authorised technicians are adequate for a pressure vessel stored in a harsh marine environment.

Fuel contamination is a greater risk for operators that conduct refuelling in the field or at remote locations.

Clear guidance material for remote refuelling procedures is not readily accessible to general aviation operators. Advisory Circular AC91-22 and the Fuel Management â€“ Good Aviation Practice booklet both contain some information under the heading â€˜Fuelling Proceduresâ€™.

109,2017_205,026/18,the Commission recommended that the Executive Officer of the International Group of P&I Clubs disseminate the lessons learned from this accident to all of its members and advise them of the potential risk to ship safety posed by lights that radiate high levels of heat.,"The fire on board the Kokopo Chief was caused by radiated heat from an incandescent reflector lamp fitted in a cargo light igniting the timber cargo.

While it is widely known that incandescent reflector lamps produce heat, the findings of this investigation offer valuable information to ship designers, owners and operators to consider when selecting the means of lighting in cargo holds and other parts of their ships. There are equivalent lighting options, such as LED lamps, that do not produce the same high temperatures.

115,2015_009,020/18,On 23 August 2018 the Commission is therefore recommending that the Director of Civil Aviation raise public awareness of the VFR traffic around the Hamilton area and work closely with aerodrome safety groups to resolve congestion hazards and traffic flow routes into and out of the zone.,
116,2017_202,017/18,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of Environment Southland review the risk assessment for safe navigation within Fiordland and take the necessary action(s) to mitigate the risk of large cruise ships frequently transiting narrow passages with limited room for manoeuvring and with pilots on board during the hours of darkness or in other conditions of restricted visibility.,"Environment Southland manages navigational safety within the Fiordland region and is committed to undertaking and regulating marine operations for cruise ships within its area. The increasing frequency, scale and duration of cruise ship traffic through Fiordland will increase the risks. Milford Sound is not the only passage where blind pilotage can be a necessity.

There are a number of measures that the regional council could take to better manage the risks to navigation safety within Fiordland, including: the provision of more navigation aids; better training and currency for pilots in blind pilotage techniques; and even prohibiting night navigation of certain passages if that were felt necessary.

118,2016_206,013/18,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand review the current requirements for the carriage of lifejackets on commercial restricted-limit vessels, and use an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the required lifejackets are of an appropriate type for the type and place of operation.","The Commission is of the view that for commercial operations in exposed open waters, particularly when vessels are approved to operate out of bar harbours, the minimum requirement should be a type 401 lifejacket, and it should be required to have a crotch strap fitted. For the same reasons, Maritime New Zealand should place some emphasis in its safety campaigns on recommending that recreational users adopt a similar standard when intending to cross bar harbours or venture into exposed coastal waters.

On 23 May 2018 "
119,2017_102,011/18,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review KiwiRailâ€™s system for training and ongoing performance monitoring for signal box operators to ensure that they are fully familiar with the capabilities of the equipment and the layout of the yards they are controlling.,"Notwithstanding the fault in the mimic screen, the signallers had a surprising lack of familiarity with the physical layout of the yard they were controlling, particularly as one of the signallers had some 13 yearsâ€™ experience in the Wellington signal box. The fact that no-one was aware that the mimic screen was not representative of the actual yard layout is an issue.

123,2017_001,016/18,"the Commission recommended that the chief executive of Way To Go Heliservices review the companyâ€™s internal quality assurance system to ensure that:
- there are robust systems in place for establishing the actual weight and balance of all company aircraft for all operations
- incidents and accidents are recorded, notified to the CAA and investigated, and corrective actions are taken as appropriate
- pilots are fully aware of and observe the operating limitations of all the aircraft types and variants that they fly.","The operator did not have adequate systems available for the pilot to determine the actual all-up weight and balance of the helicopter for the firefighting operation, or to ensure that incidents such as the previous loss of a window were recorded, notified to the CAA and investigated. The use of a prohibited door configuration suggested inadequate awareness of and adherence to flight manual limitations, which often differ between otherwise similar variants of an aircraft.

129,2016_201,035/17,"The Commission recommends to the Director of MNZ that he promotes the need for people and organisations involved in the design, installation and use of any fixed fire-fighting systems to fully document and understand the principles and operation of those systems.","The CO2 fixed fire-fighting system installed in the engine room of the PeeJay V was not fully effective in extinguishing the fire because the space it was protecting was not, and could not, be fully closed down.

When the CO2 system was triggered it did suppress the fire, but only for a few minutes. The reason for this was there was four ways for fresh air to enter the engine room after the CO2 had been injected into the compartment.

The construction of the engine room did not allow the compartment to be fully sealed, which rendered the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system ineffective.

The crew were not sufficiently familiar with the principles of the CO2 fixed fire-fighting system for the engine room, which meant they lacked the knowledge to ensure the integrity of the system before and during the fire.

"
130,2016_101,033/17,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail liaise with Greater Wellington Regional Council to develop a long-term strategy for the metropolitan rail system, with a view to identifying and addressing the current safety issues with the track and signalling infrastructure in the Wellington Station area.","There is a heightened risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station because limited available space makes the track layout congested. The existing layout means there are fewer safety overlaps designed into this area and fewer fail-safe back-up systems in place in the event of a driver failing to stop at a red light.

Any increases in commuter train services into and out of Wellington through this tight track layout increases the pressure on this bottleneck area, and in turn increases the underlying risk of relying on train drivers to stop at red lights.
To decongest and modernise the track and signal infrastructure at Wellington Station will require significant resources, which is unlikely to occur in the near future. 
However, there will likely be future increases in rail patronage and the system is already congested.

On 15 December 2017, "
131,2016_101,034/17,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail conduct a review of current arrangements and take any opportunities it can to further reduce the risk of train operations in the area until a more suitable longer-term solution can be made.,"There are a number of reasonable measures that had not been taken to further reduce the risk of trains colliding within the approaches to Wellington Station, such as:
- providing better recognition of signals
- standard procedures for signalling trains through the area
- better communication between train drivers and persons controlling the trains.

This incident has shown that more work is required of KiwiRail to further reduce the likelihood of trains colliding within the Wellington Station area.

141,2016_102,025/17,"On 24 August 2017, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review its post-incident drug and alcohol policy to ensure that all personnel directly involved in an accident and/or operating incident are asked to submit to testing.",
142,2016_102,024/17,"On 24 August 2017, the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review its change management processes to ensure that changes in policies, procedures and rules are communicated effectively to staff and appropriate procedures are in place to measure compliance with the changes.",
143,2015_103,023/17,The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail that he address KiwiRailâ€™s low-ratio random testing programme.,"KiwiRail's records of random drug and alcohol tests for the three years from 2013 to 2015 showed that 95% of the positive results had related to employees working in its safety-critical infrastructure maintenance and train operations areas. KiwiRail's practice of randomly testing 10% of its workforce annually means that an individual is potentially tested once every 10 years, which is consistent with the rail protection officer not having been randomly tested in the previous 10 years.

Random testing is more useful than post-incident testing, as it is designed to act as a deterrent and prevent accidents and incidents instead of finding out after the event. The more likely staff are to be tested, the bigger the deterrent.

Comparative rail companies in New Zealand and Australia are testing at higher ratios, with some achieving a 50% testing programme within a 12-month period.

"
144,2015_201,026/17,"On 23 August 2017, the Commission recommended that Maritime New Zealand issue guidance and advice to operators and surveyors about the need to take a risk-based approach when determining the level of surveyor oversight required for changes to critical systems, regardless of whether or not the changes are considered major modifications.",
148,2013_010,009/17,the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation ensure that helicopter operators who conduct snow landings address in their safety management systems the hazard of passenger disembarkation and embarkation during those landings while the rotors are turning.,"A safety issue identified during the inquiry was the widespread practice of allowing passengers to leave and return to helicopters parked on snow while the rotors are turning. Frequently the pilot will also disembark to guide the passengers while they move under the main rotor disc. There is a serious risk to people on the ground if a helicopter has settled into fresh snow or it breaks through an apparently hard surface crust. Should this happen the clearance between the rotor disc and people walking beneath could reduce sufficiently for someone to be struck by the rotor blades.

150,2015_001,018/17,"Skydive Taupo did not equip its parachute drop pilots with lifejackets and was not required to do so, because its flights from TaupÅ aerodrome, which used the TaupÅ aerodrome parachute landing area, remained within gliding distance of land at all times. This accident illustrated how that scenario downplayed the possibility of a pilot having to ditch an aeroplane, or bale out and drift to a water landing.

Therefore the Commission is recommending that the Chief Executive of Skydive Taupo investigate options for equipping their parachute drop pilots with effective flotation devices.",
151,2014_105,017/17,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail review the company's Fitness for Work Policy to ensure that the workloads of personnel undertaking safety-critical work, including staff not on a roster, are managed effectively and that the risk of their suffering from the effects of fatigue is mitigated.","The approval process authorised one person to carry out the rail protection duties for two separate worksites within a protected work area throughout a 52.5-hour track occupation period without appointing a relief rail protection officer. The rail protection officer had worked relatively long hours during the week leading up to the incident and had had no days completely free of work.

170,2016_202,016/16,"On 2 August 2016 the Commission recommended that before allowing cruise ships to use Tory Channel in future, the Chief Executive of the Marlborough District Council review its harbour risk assessment for the safe navigation of ships through Tory Channel, and in doing so consider the safe navigation of cruise ships through Tory Channel as a separate risk. The new risk assessment should consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:

- the limited number of piloted ships using Tory Channel make it difficult for harbour pilots to maintain currency
- cruise ship crews will not be familiar with Tory Channel
- harbour pilots will not necessarily be familiar with the manoeuvring characteristics and the navigation equipment of ships they are piloting
- there is only a short time available before transiting Tory Channel for a pilot and a shipâ€™s crew to form a cohesive bridge team
- as well as the Tory Channel entrance itself, the remainder of Tory Channel is narrow, with significant Cook Strait passenger-ferry traffic. In order to help mitigate the risk of collisions between ships under pilotage and passenger ferries, pilots' passage plans would need to be aligned with those of the passenger ferries.",

174,2014_101,013/16,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and all road controlling authorities to ensure that rail level crossing assessments include a measure of the road profile and compatibility with the allowable dimensions for long and low road vehicles.,"It is possible that the Te Onetea Road level crossing is one that has been affected by changes in the allowable dimensions of long, low road vehicles. Unless the profiles of all level crossings are assessed against the current allowable dimensions for long, low vehicles, the potential risk of this type of accident occurring will remain high.

The ALCAM survey measures the gradient of the road leading up to the level crossing, but does not measure the rate of change in gradient in order to record the profile or vertical alignment of the road for the purposes of ensuring that road-legal vehicles can use the level crossing safely without becoming stuck.

It is important that rail level crossings are compatible with road vehicles, and that road users are made aware of limitations on the use of at-risk level crossings, in much the same way that drivers of high vehicles are warned of low bridges and tunnels.

"
175,2014_101,012/16,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with KiwiRail and Waikato District Council to address this safety issue.,"A survey of the Te Onetea Road level crossing was carried out to the ALCAM standards on 20 March 2012. The sighting distances in both directions did not allow sufficient time for long vehicles to drive safely over the level crossing without being struck by a train. Therefore, a fully road-compliant long vehicle could not use the level crossing with the recommended margins for safety.

No action had been taken between the 2012 survey and the date of the accident, 27 February 2014, to mitigate the risk to road users and train vehicles. "

197,2014_103,005/15,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency require a full review of the National Rail System standards, and in particular standard No. 6, to ensure that low adhesion braking requirements are defined in the standards and made applicable for all trains intended to operate on the National Rail System.","Rail Standards for New Trains

The National Rail System Standards (6) (Engineering and Interoperability) is the only standard within the National Rail System set that defines braking performance. However, it does not address the performance in low adhesion conditions of modern metropolitan passenger trains that are fitted with computer controlled brake and wheel slide protection systems. The current National Rail System Standard (6) does not require any more from a braking system than for a train to be able to stop within a specified distance in dry conditions.

The regulator for the country of operation or the purchaser may define what adhesion conditions might be encountered on a rail network and what level of braking performance is expected from a new train and what standards the train is to be tested to for compliance. This is also the stage in commissioning a new train, when the interaction between all of the brake systems is adjusted to achieve the optimum overall brake performance.  The Rail Safety and Standards Board in UK have produced a Guidance Note (GM/GN2695) to achieve this purpose in the UK but nothing similar exists for New Zealand.

The Matangi train brake systems were tested for compliance and proper operation, but they were not tested and adjusted for optimum brake performance in low adhesion conditions.

In Wellington, where new trains were commissioned into service with computer controlled braking and wheel slide protection systems, but that the complete train braking systems were not optimised to achieve the most effective brake performance in low adhesion conditions.  The Commission considers that the occurrences in Wellington may be repeated unless the National Rail System standards are revised. 

As a minimum the Commission considers that the National Rail System standards should call upon appropriate international standards to formalise new train type testing and ensure that train braking systems are tested in low adhesion conditions and optimised for the train.

"
198,2014_103,006/15,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the New Zealand Transport Agency review the process followed for the commissioning of the Auckland trains, and if they have not been optimised for low adhesion conditions or adhesion management systems introduced to reduce the risk of incidents across the network, he address those safety issues in line with the safety actions planned for the Matangi train operation.""","Auckland Trains

The Commission is aware that new passenger trains have recently been introduced in Auckland.  The Commission is not aware of any safety issues with the new trains but expects they would have been tested to comply with the same National Rail System standards as the Matangi trains in Wellington. Therefore, they may be exposed to the same lack of optimised brake performance risks in low adhesion conditions.

"
199,2014_102,004/15,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail provide clear guidelines to train controllers on the practice of providing additional advice to train drivers on route setting or any other unusual factors that are likely to affect the progress of or the manner in which they drive their trains.,"The train driver in this instance had several weeks earlier received a radio call about a divergent path to bypass a disabled passenger train at Otahuhu. However, on this occasion he did not receive a similar radio call warning him that his train was not going to follow the usual path.

The circumstances of this latest accident provide further evidence that additional advice to train drivers about conditions that are likely to affect their trains can help to prevent accidents.

Currently the KiwiRail policy on the issue is unclear, which can lead to uncertainty among train drivers and, as in this case, false expectations among drivers, causing them to not pay full attention to the trackside signals to which they should be driving.

"
200,2014_202,002/15,the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand submit this report to the International Maritime Organization and raise the implications that plastic-sheathed wire ropes have for maritime safety through the appropriate International Maritime Organization safety committee for its consideration.,"The wire pennants parted under tensile overload because they had all been significantly weakened by severe corrosion. Corrosion had gone undetected inside a plastic sheathing that the manufacturer of the lifting sling had placed around the wire pennants.

The presence of the plastic sheathing encasing the wire rope meant that neither the crew nor the various surveyors tasked with inspecting the launching system could inspect and maintain the wire rope as required by SOLAS.

Encasing steel wire in plastic sheathing when it is to be used in the marine environment has significant implications for maritime safety, especially when the wire must be regularly inspected and maintained in order to remain fit for purpose.

On 26 February 2015 "
201,2014_202,001/15,"the Commission recommended that the Director of Maritime New Zealand, through the port and flag state control programme, verify that wires that require regular inspection and maintenance by a shipâ€™s crew and surveyors are readily accessible and easily maintained as required by Chapter VI of the International Life-Saving Appliance Code.","The wire pennants parted under tensile overload because they had all been significantly weakened by severe corrosion.

202,2013_009,024/14,"The Commission recommends that the Chief of Air Force review the risk assessment for using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctic flight operations, taking into account these matters and any other matters not considered during the initial risk assessment.","There was a low likelihood of the weather conditions at Pegasus Field aerodrome deteriorating below minima after an aeroplane passed the point of safe return. However, the potential consequences of that happening were elevated for the Boeing 757 aircraft because of the lack of alternative approach paths and aerodromes suitable for this aircraft type.

There are five factors that were not considered, or only partly considered, but should have been when assessing the risk of using the Boeing 757 aircraft for Antarctica operations:

- the weather criteria for an aeroplane passing the point of safe return should consider the presence of low cloud and fog below the main cloud base as a limiting factor
- there is an increased likelihood of weather conditions deteriorating below minima early in the summer season
- the accuracy of instrument approaches should be treated with caution prior to calibration flights being conducted early in the summer season
- the RNZAF aircraft is capable of completing one type of instrument approach only in Antarctica - a GPS approach
- the lack of suitable diversion airfields and the consequences of a whiteout landing.

"
203,2013_002,026/14,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he provide specific guidance to Civil Aviation Rule Part 145 certified companies, for the performance of conformity inspections of parts and components with unknown service histories or incomplete airworthiness documentation, or that have been stored improperly.","An engine that had been involved in a sudden stoppage incident overseas was put through a conformity inspection and released to service in New Zealand without the required inspections having been completed. The regulator's guidelines for inspecting used parts of unknown origin was not well defined, and the company's approved procedures developed from these guidelines were not adequate in this case. A thorough research of the engine's history, seeking further details of the accident and clarification from the vendor, would have likely uncovered the sudden stoppage event, and the required inspections would have been carried out.

On 10 December 2014 "
204,2013_002,025/14,the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he promote the use of quick-donning life jackets for all occupants of single-engine aircraft flying over water.,"Civil Aviation Rule 91.525 requires a life jacket to be available for each person on board a single-engine aircraft being flown beyond the gliding distance from shore. The life jacket is to be stowed in a readily accessible position. The Commission has previously recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that on all flights, if at any point a ditching is likely to have a better outcome than a forced landing on unfavourable terrain, life jackets should be carried. Helicopters descend at a much higher rate in autorotation than an aeroplane does when gliding. Therefore, even if life jackets are carried, helicopter passengers are likely to be faced with minimal time to find and fit their life jackets if faced with a ditching.

On 10 December 2014 "
205,2011_204,012/14,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand promote, through the appropriate IMO forum, the importance of sharing amongst member states information regarding the quality of member states' maritime education, training and certification systems, including a consideration of making the five-yearly evaluations of member states' available to other member states.","Member States are required to undergo five-yearly independent evaluations of their seafarer training systems. However, those evaluations remain confidential between the IMO, the auditing States and the States being assessed. According to Regulation I/10, member States are required to verify for themselves the effectiveness of other States' maritime education, training and certification systems before recognising certificates issued by those States. However, this can only be realistically achieved through a full systemic audit of the seafarer training system. If this were to happen it is likely that the global training system would be unnecessarily overburdened. This safety issue could be resolved if reports made after the five-yearly independent evaluations were required to be made available to other member states.

"
206,2011_204,010/14,The Commission recommends that CIEL evaluate the effectiveness of its safety management system to ensure that the issues identified with that system as applied on board the Rena do not affect other vessels within its fleet.,"On board the Rena, the master and crew were not following the navigation and watchkeeping standards and procedures set down in the Rena's safety management system for at least the six coastal voyages leading up to the grounding.

With respect to port state control records, other vessels managed by CIEL also had a higher than average rate of deficiencies than the average for the Asia-Pacific region.

"
207,2013_106,023/14,"The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency that he address with KiwiRail the safety issue whereby KiwiRail's standard policy and procedures allowed an ""at-risk"" train controller to continue working at train control workstations while undergoing a formal investigation and remedial process after KiwiRail had identified issues that would have affected his ability to perform his safety-critical role effectively.","The train controller had been identified by KiwiRail management as having concentration and focus issues in relation to tasks required for the safe execution of track occupation authorities following a track occupation irregularity during February 2012. This was 16 months before the track occupation irregularity covered in this report, and during that period the train controller went on to have two further operating irregularities while he remained in the role.

"
208,2012_102,022/14,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail revise the risk rating assessment matrix in its Risk Management Policy to reflect the fact that train control is a safety-critical service, and to consider the safety of people in crowds when assessing and mitigating the risks.","KiwiRail's Risk Management Policy for ""continuity of core services"" did not give proper consideration to the safety of passengers and crew when a core service such as train control failed, causing the widespread stoppage of an entire metropolitan passenger rail system.

209,2011_204,013/14,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consider the use of virtual aids to navigation and monitor progress through the International Air Transport Association (IATA) of the development of performance criteria for them, but meanwhile work with regional councils and port companies to control the use of virtual aids to navigation until they have been fully assessed and appropriate performance criteria set by IATA and Maritime New Zealand.","It is probable that if an aid to navigation of some type had been installed on Astrolabe Reef, the Rena grounding would have been prevented. However, there are many such isolated dangers to navigation around the coast of New Zealand. Installing and maintaining physical navigational aids on remote hazards is costly. Virtual aids to navigation are potentially a cost-effective means of marking such isolated dangers. However, these are still being trialled by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities and no performance criteria have yet been set regarding their accuracy and intended use. The Commission noted during its inquiry that although the technology is relatively new and there is no regulatory framework in place, some port authorities are already beginning to use virtual aids to navigation. There is a potential safety issue around the use of aids to navigation that have not been fully tested.

"
210,2011_204,014/14,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand begin to collate national data on shipping movements around the New Zealand coast that will in future enable Maritime New Zealand and local government authorities to monitor the potential need to introduce ship routing of some form.,"There is insufficient data available on the New Zealand coast to make any meaningful analysis of shipping routes, density of ship traffic or potential areas of shipping convergence that might warrant the introduction of local ship routing systems.

"
211,2014_103,021/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail relocate the terminal pole for the overhead line at Melling Station to be clear of the potential train overrun path.,"The stop block at Melling was mounted directly in front of the terminal (last) pole supporting the high-voltage overhead contact wire for the electric trains. At the previous collision in 2013 the support structure was damaged, and in this recent 2014 event the pole was snapped off at ground level, causing the overhead contact wire to drop onto the body of the train. The fallen high-voltage line created a risk to the train occupants and delayed the evacuation of the train after it came to rest.
Placing the power pole directly in line with the stop block was a safety issue that increased the potential consequences of a train overrunning the station platform and striking the stop block.

"
212,2014_103,018/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail apply a suitable permanent speed restriction to the last section of the Melling Line to reduce the approach speed to Melling Station.,"Two trains have collided with the stop block at Melling Station in the space of just over one year. The normal line speed for the section of track between the preceding station and Melling is 70 km/h. The Melling Station platform only becomes clearly visible to the train driver once the train has rounded the last bend, about 400 m from the stop block. If trains were restricted to a lower speed before they rounded the last bend, the risk of a platform overrun and resulting collision with the stop block would be reduced.
"
213,2014_103,020/14,The Commission recommends that KiwiRail replace the type of stop block that was in use at Melling with a new shock-absorbing type design that would be matched to the likely impact forces from a Matangi train.,"The stop block installed at Melling was a solid concrete block with a limited ability to absorb impact forces. It was physically shifted in the first collision, and even further in the second. The second impact also split the concrete block near ground level and allowed it to rotate backward under the train. The train rode up and over the stop block as a consequence, sustaining substantial damage.
Modern shock-absorbing stop blocks used on other terminating train stations on the controlled network reduce the consequences in terms of injury to persons and damage to trains if overruns should occur that lead to trains striking the stop blocks.
"
214,2014_103,019/14,The Commission further recommends that KiwiRail assess all other terminating stations on the controlled network throughout New Zealand and similarly apply permanent speed restrictions as necessary to the approaches at those stations.,
215,2013_201,017/14,On 25 June 2014 the Commission recommended that the operating company for the Taokas Wisdom focus in more detail on the effectiveness of the emergency-response training on board all ships under its management.,

225,2011_003,006/14,On 26 February 2014 the Commission recommended that the Director of Civil Aviation continue to support the international work underway to improve the crash survivability of ELTs and to include GPS information in the data transmitted by such devices.,
226,2011_203,027/13,the Commission recommended to the Chief Executive of Auckland Council that he co-ordinates the ferry companies that operate large passenger ferries on the major Hauraki Gulf routes to adopt ferry design features and training programmes aimed at minimising the risk of a ship-to-ship transfer of passengers when the need arises to abandon a passenger ferry.,"Most of the Fullers vessels operate in enclosed or inshore limits, and in areas frequently plied by other ferries and recreational vessels. In the past 10 years there have been a number of incidents and accidents involving passenger ferries in the Auckland area, and on almost every occasion the passengers have not needed to enter life-rafts. Instead they have been transferred to other vessels in the vicinity.

Although passenger transfer is the more likely method for abandoning ship in the congested Hauraki Gulf, the crews do not practise transferring passengers from one vessel to another, nor do they practise bringing one vessel alongside another. The vessels in Fullers' fleet have subtly different heights of rubbing strips, and access and egress points. There would be merit in introducing this into the training schedule, and also merit in considering subtle design changes to better facilitate ship-to-ship passenger transfers.

227,2013_108,024/13,the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency takes all appropriate steps to ensure that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendations.,"The Commission has made 2 recommendations to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail, that he:

1. Install some form of protection that will automatically stop a train that has overrun Signal 38 in the Wellington station area, and that he review other signalling arrangements in busy, high-risk metro passenger areas to ensure that the same arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of train collisions for the same or similar reasons.

2. Take the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversations with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule.

On 23 October "
228,2013_108,023/13,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail takes the necessary action to reinforce to all staff the existing rule forbidding non-operational conversation with train drivers, and use some means of monitoring compliance with the rule.","Driver distraction has the potential to contribute to or cause serious accidents and incidents.

In this case the driver of the passenger train was distracted by engaging in a non-operational conversation with the train manager, and failed to stop his train at a red signal.

On 23 October 2013, "
229,2011_106,026/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take all appropriate steps to ensure that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendation.,"It is important that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendation, which is aimed at addressing the safety issues examined in this report. The NZ Transport Agency has various powers under the Railways Act 2005 to monitor and ensure KiwiRail's performance and compliance.

"
230,2011_106,025/13,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place, and are being applied, to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions about the locations of trains and other rail vehicles.","The train controller in this case made an assumption that the passenger train had passed a particular location based on information from the person-in-charge. Rather than verifying the train's location, the train controller acted on his assumption and authorised the person-in-charge to occupy a section of track that the passenger train was approaching.

Train controllers must not make assumptions about the locations of trains without first verifying their locations. Unless KiwiRail and train controllers remain alert to this risk and take all appropriate steps to minimise the likelihood of train controllers making assumptions, further incidents could occur, perhaps with more serious consequences.

"
231,2013_108,022/13,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail install some form of protection that will automatically stop a train that has overrun Signal 38 in the Wellington Station area, and that he reviews other signalling arrangements in busy, high risk metro passenger areas to ensure the same arrangements are in place to minimise the risk of train collisions for the same or similar reasons.","The near collision occurred at a convergence of several busy metro passenger lines and there was no automatic protection applied to preventing such a collision in the event of a driver failing to stop at Signal 38.

Equivalent signals protecting other lines into Wellington station have been fitted with signal trips that automatically apply a train's brakes in the event of it overrunning the signal. A signal trip fitted to Signal 38 would have automatically applied the passenger train brakes in this case.

On 23 October 2013, "
232,2012_001,012/13,"The post-mortem toxicology results for the pilot in the Carterton hot air balloon showed that he had a positive result for tetrahydrocannabinol (a constituent of cannabis). It was likely that this was due to 2 factors: first, the pilot smoking cannabis shortly before the accident flight; and, second, residual tetrahydrocannabinol, from ingesting cannabis over a longer term, redistributing in the pilotâ€™s blood after his death.

The Commission found that the accident was caused by errors of judgement by the pilot. It also found that it could not exclude the possibility that the pilot's performance had been impaired as a result of ingesting cannabis.

This is not the first time that the Commission has inquired into occurrences where persons operating aircraft, vessels or rail vehicles, or where persons performing functions directly relevant to the operation of these, have tested positive for performance-impairing substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol. The Commission is increasingly seeing more occurrences where the use of performance-impairing substances is a feature.

Unless this safety issue is properly addressed, further occurrences where the use of performance-impairing substances is a contributing factor will occur. Legislative or regulatory reform in this area is necessary.

The Commission, therefore, recommends that the Secretary for Transport complete, as a matter of priority, all necessary work that will support the introduction of appropriate legislation or rules that will:
- prescribe allowable maximum levels for alcohol
- prohibit persons from operating an aircraft, vessel or rail vehicle if they are impaired by drugs
- require operators to implement drug and alcohol detection and deterrence regimes, including random testing
- prescribe post-occurrence testing requirements for drugs and alcohol.

This legislation or these rules should apply:
- across the aviation, maritime and rail transport modes
- to persons operating an aircraft or a marine craft for recreational purposes.",

238,2013_104,020/13,"the Commission recommended that the Chief Executive of KiwiRail urgently address this safety issue by ensuring that at the Wellington maintenance depot, and other maintenance depots under KiwiRail control:
- maintenance is undertaken in accordance with good railway engineering practice
- manufacturersâ€™ inspection, repair and maintenance instructions are documented and followed
- safety-critical components are identified and documented
- work instructions are issued for maintaining all equipment
- work on safety-critical components is signed off by someone other than the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance work
- all maintenance work is recorded.","There were 2 safety issues identified with the Wellington maintenance depot processes:
- there were no individual task instructions on how each job was to be done
- there was no check sheet associated with each task to record that important steps and checks for the task had been completed.

Instead, the depot relied on the knowledge of the depot staff to complete each task satisfactorily.

These shortcomings in maintenance control could be indicators of other safety issues within the wider maintenance system at the Wellington maintenance depot.

239,2013_104,021/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take all appropriate steps to ensure that KiwiRail addresses the above recommendation.,"The Commission has made an urgent recommendation to the Chief Executive of KiwiRail that he ensure that at the Wellington maintenance depot, and other maintenance depots under KiwiRail control:

"
240,2011_004,018/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he take action, in concert with the aviation industry, to improve the level of compliance with Civil Aviation Rules and conformance with industry best practice throughout the general aviation maintenance sector.","The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that general aviation maintenance practices in New Zealand are not always in accordance with Civil Aviation Rules or accepted industry practice. The findings show that non-compliance occurs in certificated maintenance organisations and by individual maintenance engineers exercising their individual licence privileges. This is an indication that the safety issue is not specific to just one sector of aviation maintenance. If left unchecked this situation is likely to have significant implications for aviation safety.

On 25 July 2013 "
241,2011_004,019/13,"the Commission recommended to the Director of Civil Aviation that he widen the range of aircraft systems that require duplicate checks after specified maintenance, at least for those aircraft used in air transport operations, in order to reduce the likelihood of recurring defects and incidents.","The requirement for duplicate inspections after maintenance is performed on critical aircraft systems reduces the risk of a maintenance error remaining undetected and causing an accident. However, there are only a few specified control systems that are deemed critical and that require duplicate inspections. There are other important systems â€“ for example, the landing gear and brakes â€“ that are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. This is a safety issue, particularly for aircraft used in air transport operations where the consequences of an accident could be greater.

The findings from 2 separate inquiries show that because duplicate inspections are currently confined to critical control systems only, the risk of undetected maintenance errors in important, but non-critical, aircraft systems is not sufficiently mitigated. This accident was a prime example of how maintenance errors that are made in an important system and that are not detected then or during subsequent maintenance can become causal factors in an accident. The risks were higher in this case because the relevant maintenance events had been performed by independent engineers on parts of an aeroplane sub-system that were not subject to duplicate inspections.

On 25 July 2013 "
242,2010_204,004/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand consult port and harbour authorities and the New Zealand Maritime Pilots Association to develop a formal system for port and harbour authority employees to report vessel defects and crew performance issues. The purpose of the system should be to make information immediately available to maritime employees who can use the information to improve the safety of pilotage operations at subsequent ports. The purpose of the system should not be to replace the mandatory reporting of accidents and incidents, but instead to disseminate that information in a timely fashion to prevent similar accidents and incidents in the immediate future.","The number of defects that are causing incidents and accidents in New Zealand pilotage waters is of concern. It is an indication that New Zealand port and harbour authorities cannot totally rely on the International Safety Management system to ensure that vessels transiting New Zealand ports are operated safely and efficiently. Minor technical defects and human performance issues are often lead indicators of deeper systemic safety issues on board a vessel. If the issues of mechanically unreliable vessels and substandard crew resource management on vessels operating into New Zealand ports are to be addressed, this will need to be done at a national level rather than individual ports dealing with the issues as they arise.

"
243,2011_103,007/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency work with the National Rail System Standard Executive in developing a National Rail System Standard that requires all rail participants to have drug and alcohol policies that: have zero tolerance of performance-impairing substances for workers engaged in safety-critical tasks; require post-incident and accident and random testing for drugs and alcohol; and require a system for rail workers to report discreetly co-workers suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the workplace.,"The protection person was a user of cannabis. Although it could not be established scientifically that his performance was impaired by cannabis at the time of the incident, he did have a detectable level of THC-acid in his urine when he was tested after the incident.
Under no circumstances should the performance of any rail worker performing any safety-critical task be affected by alcohol or drugs of any kind. "
244,2010_204,005/13,"The Commission recommends that, once the Marine Legislation Bill has been enacted and the new Part 3A of the Maritime Transport Act is in force, the Director address this safety issue with all port authorities, including Port of Tauranga Limited, when approving and auditing Port and Harbour Safety Management Systems.","Vessels' machinery installations and their control systems are complex, and regardless of how well maintained they are there will always remain the possibility that some part fails for some reason. For a vessel like the Hanjin Bombay that has only one propulsion system, the risk of losing control of the vessel caused by a single-point failure is higher than that for other vessels that have greater levels of redundancy built in to their propulsion and power-management systems. These types of vessel rely heavily on tug services when operating in confined pilotage waters.
Port of Tauranga Limited's Port and Harbour Safety system policy on the level of tug service did not adequately manage the risk of single-point failures leading to the loss of control of a vessel. This is a safety issue that could also be relevant to other New Zealand ports.
The Maritime Transport Act 1994 currently restricts the Director's powers to audit port operators. However, the Commission notes that the Marine Legislation Bill currently before Parliament will introduce a new Part 3A to the Maritime Transport Act, which will provide clear authority for the Director to take action in relation to port operations.
"
245,2011_103,006/13,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency take the necessary steps to ensure that KiwiRail's safety system maintains accurate and up-to-date training and revalidation records of all staff competencies. The action taken should also check that KiwiRail's safety system ensures that all staff are qualified and competent for their roles.,"At the time of this incident KiwiRailâ€™s safety system could not ensure that infrastructure staff were competent to perform their roles, and could not ensure that the appropriate safety observations and revalidations of current staff competency had been undertaken.
"
246,2012_201,002/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand clarifies with industry the legal requirements around dual purpose use of vessels and the use of commercial vessels as pleasure craft, and ensures that safe ship management documents refer to the full requirements an owner must comply with before the vessel is used for another purpose.",
247,2012_201,003/13,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand addresses these 2 safety issues in any educational campaigns by making it clear that not all life jackets that can be purchased in New Zealand are approved and meet the requirements of New Zealand Maritime Rules, and that persons who have a large physique should purchase or be provided with a life jacket that is appropriate for their physique.","A number of the passengers and crew on the Easy Rider had a large physique. There were only 3 adult and one child lifejackets on board to share among 9 passengers and crew. The 3 adult lifejackets were not large enough to be securely fitted to those passengers and crew whom had a large physique. The Maritime Rules make provision for the carriage of childrenâ€™s lifejackets but are silent on the need for larger lifejackets to cater for people whom have a large physique. This is a safety issue.
Larger oversize approved life jackets are available in New Zealand, and at least one manufacturer will custom make a life jacket to suit.
Maritime Rules require that an approved life jacket be carried for every person on board every recreational and commercial vessel. While an approved life jacket is marked as complying with the appropriate standard, other life jackets are freely available for purchase that are not approved to the appropriate standard, yet they are often labelled as being approved to some other standard that is not accepted in New Zealand. An unwary purchaser, particularly a recreational boating person, could be misled into thinking they were purchasing a life jacket approved to New Zealand standards. This is another safety issue.
"
248,2012_201,001/13,"The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand develops and maintains a system for centralising important operating and safety records for every commercial vessel in the New Zealand maritime system, including a policy on the retention and disposal of records that would best ensure records are kept for an appropriate period after a vessel leaves the system.","Following the accident, the Commission had some difficulty accessing sufficient information about the Easy Rider, a vessel that was still actively in the system. Maritime New Zealand was not able to find the older part of the ship file. Consequently the Commission had to rely on records from other vessels in order to make a reasonable assessment of the Easy Rider's stability.
When the Easy Rider was converted for inshore trawling it was required to undergo a simplified stability assessment, which it did, but the records sourced from the safe ship management company included only partial details of the inclining test and stability calculation that had been carried out. There was no record of the stability advice letter said to have been sent to the owner. Such a letter would normally include recommendations on the loading of the vessel.
Because commercial vessels can frequently change ownership and their owners can switch between safe ship management providers, there is a need for Maritime New Zealand to maintain a central database of all important safety and operation records for the entire life of each vessel in the system.
"
249,2010_008,029/12,"The Commission recommends that the Director use the appropriate forums and publications to educate and remindinforms flight instructors at all levels of the findings of this report, and in particular that their first responsibility is the safety of the aircraft they are commanding before attending to the needs of their student pilot.  Further, andinstructors are reminded of their responsibility for ensuring a student pilot is informed and competent to listen for, see and avoid other aircraft before allowing them to fly solo.","The Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions both involved instructors who, because of their experience and training, should have been the most capable of the pilots to be able to recognise the potential for a mid-air collision and take avoiding action.  It appears that in these cases the instructors might have been focusing more on instructing or examining the student pilots and less on ensuring the safety of their aircraft.
  
"
250,2010_008,030/12,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation takes measuresuseuse the lessons from this report to educate pilots at all levels of the aviation industry, and in particular flight training establishments, of:

- How important the concept of see-and-avoid is for detecting    and avoiding other aircraft
- The limitations of the concept of see-and-avoid
- The importance of making clear and concise radio transmissions to warn other aircraft of your location and   intentions, and the importance of listening to radio transmissions from other aircraft to help build an accurate   mental picture of the situation around you.","Paraparaumu and Feilding mid-air collisions have shown that despite pilots making appropriate radio transmissions, they have failed to actively listen and respond appropriately to the transmissions of others and take action to avoid a collision.  

The Commission also notes that limitations with the concept of see-and-avoid probably contributed to the Paraparaumu and Fielding mid-air collisions as well as the near miss above New Plymouth.

"
251,2010_008,031/12,"The Commission recommends that the Director of Civil Aviation initiate a review of aircraft anti-collision lighting systems, including the use of high-visibility paints, to determine whether there are systems that can increase the visibility of aircraft; and if such systems are found to exist Report 10-008 | Page 43 with demonstrable safety benefits, start action to promote, encourage or mandate their application in the New Zealand civil aviation system","Various aircraft paint schemes have shown to have little benefit in improving the conspicuity of aircraft for the wide range of weather, environmental and geographical conditions likely to be encountered.  Similarly the current minimum aircraft lighting requirements are not always effective in attracting the attention of pilots in bright conditions.  

However, more modern high intensity strobe lighting can increase the ability for an aircraft to be detected in most lighting conditions and could improve the reliability of â€˜see-and-avoidâ€™ as a primary means of preventing mid-air collisions.

The signal alert device that was installed in train cabs to help drivers remember the aspect of the last signal their train had passed was not used by the driver on this occasion and was not widely used by other drivers because, once activated, the alarm sounded for 6 seconds and could not be cancelled and the sound was easily confused with other in-cab alarms.

263,2010_102,022/12,The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive of the NZ Transport Agency monitor the development of current prototype improvements in crashworthiness for the Ganz Mavag rail fleet and requires that such improvements be adopted for any trains that are to remain in service for an appreciable time.,"The driving compartments on Trains 6250 and 6247 were damaged during the collision sequence to such an extent that had the drivers not vacated their driving positions before impact it was likely that they would have been at least seriously injured.  Although the Ganz Mavag trains were generally strong and well-built and had met the crashworthiness standards at the time of build some 30 years earlier, they did not perform as a more modern train would have been expected to perform during a similar front-end collision, thereby increasing the risk of injury to the driver and possibly passengers seated near the ends of the trains.
"
264,2010_102,021/12,"KiwiRailâ€™s predecessors determined that the Wellington rail electric multiple unit commuter service was not a single-person operation.  Irrespective of whether these trains were a ""single-person"" or a ""two-person"" operation, as a consequence, the radio system fitted to these trains did not have selcall capability and could not send an alert to train control automatically when there was a rapid drop in brake pipe pressure such as when the driver makes an emergency brake application.  Any delay in train control being alerted to an accident or incident within the double-tracked commuter network is a safety issue.  The Commission recommends to the Chief Executive of NZ Transport Agency that he address this safety issue.",
265,2012_201,020/12,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand trace the whereabouts of the remaining Owenga class fishing vessels and ensure that the appropriate stability calculations have been made for each vessel and alert the owners to any special stability characteristics they should be considering in the daily operation of their vessels.,"At about 2000 on 14 March 2012, the fishing vessel Easy Rider departed Bluff for Great South Cape Island off the west coast of Stewart Island.  The skipper, 2 crew members and 6 passengers were on board.  The passengers were to be offloaded at Great South Island, where they were to prepare for the upcoming mutton-bird harvest.  The skipper then intended to travel to his fishing grounds to engage in commercial fishing.

The weather at the time that the vessel sailed was described by local fishermen as poor.  It was forecast to deteriorate further with the passing of a frontal weather system across the Foveaux Strait area.  The wind was forecast to increase to about 40 to 50 knots from the northwest before easing to 15 knots from the south west after the weather front had passed.

During 14 March the skipper loaded Easy Rider with ice and bait in the fish hold, and loaded cod and crayfish pots and other associated fishing gear on the deck.  The skipper then loaded stores, equipment and personal effects for the 'mutton-birders'.  The stores and equipment covered most of the aft fishing deck and in places was stacked as high as the roof of the wheelhouse.

At about 0003 on 15 March the Easy Rider was north of the Bishop and Clerks Islands at the western end of the Foveaux Strait in an area known for strong variable currents and turbulent water.  The Easy Rider was engulfed by a large wave in this area and capsized, remaining afloat for about 2 hours before sinking.  The only survivor was one crew member who was sitting out on deck at the time.  He described the wave swamping the deck and the vessel heeling violently to port and capsizing.  4 bodies have been recovered and 4 are still missing.

The Easy Rider was believed to be built in about 1975 by Billingham to the 'Owenga' design for use in the Chatham Islands fisheries.  The vessel was constructed of steel and was about 11 metres overall length with a beam of about 3.55 metres.  It was powered by a single diesel engine.  There was thought to have been 9 of its class built.  Four (including the Easy Rider) have been lost at sea over the years for differing reasons including one that was overwhelmed by a large wave, and 5 are thought to be still in use.  One of these 5 is currently being used for commercial fishing out of Bluff.

The Commission is in the process of firstly modelling the Easy Riderâ€™s 'light ship' stability from data obtained for other vessels of the Owenga class, and secondly estimating its actual stability on the accident voyage.

The Commission has evidence that since the Owenga class fishing vessels were built, authorities have recognised that they had limited reserve stability and could become unstable if too much weight was loaded on deck.  In one case the surveyor recommended that a plaque be placed in the wheelhouse warning skippers not to load too much on deck.  The Commission has made preliminary calculations that support this view.

Thirty seven years after the Owenga class of fishing vessels were built and with successive changes in ownership, it is possible that the current owners of the remaining vessels may not be aware of the special stability characteristics of their vessels.

266,2010_202,017/12,The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand audits Coastal Bulk Shipping 2007 Limitedâ€™s safe ship management system both ashore and on board the Anatoki to ensure that it meets the standards required by the New Zealand safety management system. (017/12),"The owner and the master on board the Anatoki were not effectively managing the standards of navigation and the drug and alcohol policy at the time of the grounding.
"
267,2010_202,019/12,The Commission recommends the Director of Maritime New Zealand requires New Zealand-registered coastal vessels operating under one-man-bridge-operation to have a bridge watch navigational and alarm system to mitigate the known risk of sole watchkeepers falling asleep or becoming distracted from monitoring the progress of their vessels. (019/12),"A working bridge watch navigational and alarm system should have been fitted to the Anatoki to mitigate the known risk of one-man bridge operations.

303,2008_109,044/10,"The Commission recommends that the Chief Executive require KiwiRail Network to review the Fruitvale Road Station and associated arrangements for protecting the adjacent level crossing, to see if speed restrictions or other changes to the signalling system can be made to minimise the possibility of an overrunning train entering an unprotected level crossing, without compromising the waiting time for motorists using the level crossing. This review should be extended to other stations where the distance between the stations and level crossings is less than the recommended 150 metres.","The location of the Fruitvale Road level crossing close to the Fruitvale Road Station platform represents a risk to level-crossing users in the event of a platform overrun for whatever the reason. There is a delicate balance between the signalling ensuring the level crossing is protected in the event of a platform overrun and ensuring road users are not kept waiting for so long as to engender the known unsafe practice of road users ignoring signals and barriers and entering the level crossing ahead of passing trains.
Speed restrictions are often used around the rail network as a method of supplementing signals to ensure trains can stop within the available distance ahead without passing signals at danger.

306,2009_201,002/11,The Commission recommends that the Director of Maritime New Zealand and the Chief Executive of Local Government New Zealand address these 2 safety issues through the appropriate forum with local government organisations with a view to achieving an appropriate level of safety and consistency in safety standards on affected inland waterways.,"When a speed uplifting is granted by local government organisations or by Maritime New Zealand, this is effectively a reversal of measures taken to mitigate a previously identified risk of accidents occurring between craft travelling at high speed and other recreational water activities.
In the case of the Kawarau River, it is a safety issue that few additional measures have been taken to mitigate the additional risks that the speed uplifting has created. This situation probably exists on the Kaituna River and therefore could also exist in other waterways where the speed restrictions have been uplifted.
A second safety issue is that there is an inconsistency between Maritime Rules Part 91 where speed upliftings applied for under Rule 91.21 require a risk assessment, and then if successful, public notification and notification in the Gazette, and speed upliftings enacted by navigation bylaws that are not subject to risk assessment, approval by the Director, and publication in the Gazette.

Given the protection they can provide, it would seem that wearing them on a personal watercraft would be wise and there may be a case for it to be mandatory.
Whether wearing a helmet in a jet-boat or any other craft capable of high-speed is practicable will require some research.

The results of the risk assessment should then be used to set appropriate remedial measures to reduce the likelihood of bogie side frame failures, and could also be used to set appropriate measures to reduce main-line derailments from other causes.","The most likely reason for the side frame failures is that they had reached the end of their fatigue lives. A lack of identifying marks and records of side frame age and maintenance history means that it will be difficult to predict the onset of fatigue cracking in bogie side frames. The presence of fatigue cracking initiating in the region of the radius, just beyond the wear plate of the side frames, is difficult to detect by normal visual inspections, and at the current rate of MPIs the entire inventory of bogie side frames will not be completed until 2020. With 60% of the side frames tested consistently requiring weld repairs before being returned to service, the failure and collapse of a bogie side frame have resulted, and will continue to result, in significant damage to rolling stock and track infrastructure and the risk of serious harm to people.

313,2009_103,039/10,"The Commission recommends that the New Zealand Transport Agency oversee a review of KiwiRailâ€™s severe weather warning system and underlying processes for effective communication of warnings to ensure that it results in an appropriate level of awareness, actions and responses to severe weather events across the entire rail system.","The present severe weather warning system described by Rail Operating Rules and Procedures Section 1, Rule 6(b) does not require feedback from area managers to the network control manager on receipt of severe weather alerts, which creates an open loop information flow and prevents the network control manager from maintaining an overview of severe weather actions being taken across the entire network. Network control managers spoken to did not see maintaining an overview of actions during severe weather as their responsibility. In this case the network control manager did not monitor the severe weather alerts as they were being updated by MetService, with the result that neither the area manager nor his staff nor the locomotive engineers of trains in that area were aware of the current severe weather alert. Current contact details for recipients of severe weather warnings from network control were also allowed to lapse.

315,2009_103,040/10,The Commission recommends that the NZ Transport Agency work with the rail industry to implement a risk-management system for the slip hazards along the rail corridor.,"KiwiRail provided a draft document that demonstrated its proposed risk-ranking system for assessing the slip hazard risk along the rail corridor. It included a method for assessing potential groundwater conditions, slope stability, soil type, surface cover, slope alterations and rail traffic and outlined a framework to come up with a risk rating. The proposed rollout of this system was over the next 2 financial years but this had not been confirmed at the time of writing. Analysis of available data such as rainfall, river flows and slip activity can be a useful activity to complement the proposed risk-ranking system for determining slip hazard risk, but this data is not currently used by the rail industry. Until the risk-ranking system has been completed, the risk to the rail network from unpredicted slips is likely to be higher than is reasonably acceptable.

Even New Zealand-registered ships to which SOLAS has been applied are currently not required to be fitted with a VDR because New Zealand Maritime Rules have not been updated to incorporate changes made to SOLAS that came into effect in July 2002. Even if SOLAS requirements for VDRs had been incorporated into New Zealand Maritime Rules, the Monte Stello would not have been required to have one fitted because it was not trading internationally. The Wellington/Picton Cook Strait ferry operation combines roll-on-roll-off ships operating in challenging enclosed water pilotage and a stretch of open water renowned for challenging sea conditions.
The contribution to improving maritime safety world-wide by requiring certain classes of ships to be fitted with VDRs has been recognized by the IMO for many years, particularly for roll-on-roll-off ships such as the Monte Stello and the other current Cook Strait ferries. Until New Zealand-registered ships of the type trading across Cook Strait are fitted with VDRs or equivalent means of recording data, New Zealand and the greater maritime community are losing the potential safety benefits these devices provide.
Changes should be made to relevant New Zealand legislation that will result in all Cook Strait roll-on/roll-off ferries being required to have a fully SOLAS compliant VDR, or where not practicable to fit such equipment, other means to record as many operating parameters as practicable. (028/10)",
