Major webapp rebuild

:::incremental
- Old webapp used some basic keyword matching to try and find the relevant reports you are looking for
- New webapp uses vector database to allow for semantic search of all created database.
- We propose deploying the webapp searcher tool to a select few investigators (Tahlia, Avinash, Hamish , Rob and Ingrid) for a beta test. The test will last a few months.

# Where to go next

Next few months

After beta test and beyond
