Things to discuss

:::incremental

- **What has been completed so far**
- **What further work could be done**

:::


## Work completed this sprint

--- 

Meta data extraction

- Goal is to have a well structured dataset for later searching and analysis

:::incremental

- safety issues extraction and inference
- recommendation and safety issue linking

:::

---

Data mining

- With the created data set form the meta data extraction it is very rich with information.

. . . 

- Generating safety themes from safety issues


# Where to go next

---

Three avenues to spend resources

:::incremental

- Metadata extraction on other agencies
- Creating smart search of reports
- Data mining

:::

---

Metadata extraction on other agencies reports

:::incremental

- Extract safety issues and recommendations from each report.
- ~ 3 weeks per agencies report collection
- Allows for expansion of data mining and scope of search engine

:::

---

Creating smart search of reports

:::incremental

- Fast and intuitive finding of relevant question with VectorDB (2 weeks for prototype)
- Converse with the dataset with a RAG (2 weeks for prototype built on top of the search engine)

Data mining

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Finishing generation of safety themes from safety issues (1 week)
- Generation of recommendation themes from recommendations (2 weeks)

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Exploring data to find other useful analysis that could be performed (unbounded)
- Expansion of analysis to other agencies reports (varied)
